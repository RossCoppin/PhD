abstract = {Dispersal by passive oceanic rafting is considered important for
the assembly of biotic communities on islands. However, not much
is known about levels of population genetic connectivity
maintained by rafting over transoceanic distances. We assess the
evolutionary impact of kelp-rafting by estimating population
genetic differentiation in three kelp-associated invertebrate
species across a system of islands isolated by oceanic gaps for
over 5 million years, using mtDNA and AFLP markers. The species
occur throughout New Zealand's subantarctic islands, but lack
pelagic stages and any opportunity for anthropogenic
transportation, and hence must rely on passive rafting for
long-distance dispersal. They all have been directly observed to
survive transoceanic kelp-rafting journeys in this region. Our
analyses indicate that regular gene flow occurs among
populations of all three species between all of the islands,
especially those on either side of the subtropical front
oceanographic boundary. Notwithstanding its perceived sporadic
nature, long-distance kelp-rafting appears to enable significant
gene flow among island populations separated by hundreds of
kilometres of open ocean.},

abstract = {Some species of macroalgae continue to live for extended periods
of time after detachment and may even maintain reproductive
structures, yet very little is known about this process. Here,
we describe the presence of sporophylls (with sporogenous
tissues) on floating kelp rafts of Macrocystis spp. along the
coast of Chile. Surveys were conducted at nine sites (18?50° S)
during austral summer 2002, and floating kelp rafts were seen
and collected at seven of these nine sites (between 22 and 50°
S). Fifteen (26.8{\%}) of the 56 samples had sporophylls,
indicating maintenance of sporophylls after detachment. Some of
the kelp sporophytes with reproductive blades showed signs of
having been afloat for long periods (indicated by the large size
of attached stalked barnacles). Additionally, experiments showed
that floating kelps released viable zoospores. To understand the
reproductive dynamics of floating kelps, we compared these
results with information from attached populations of
Macrocystis spp. at nearby coastal sites. In general, attached
kelp had higher proportions of sporophylls than floating rafts,
suggesting that detachment may negatively affect reproductive
status. Nevertheless, floating kelps remained functionally
reproductive, suggesting that zoospores may be dispersed via
floating rafts. Published reports on other macroalgae indicate
that some species (Lessoniaceae, Fucaceae, and Sargassaceae) are
fertile and probably release zoospores or zygotes while floating
or drifting in ocean currents. Because dispersal distances
achieved by spores of most macroalgae are relatively short,
release of spores from floating algae may be an alternative
mechanism of long-distance dispersal.},

abstract = {Drifting rafts of Macrocystis pyrifera are formed when attached plants are separated from the substrate. These kelp rafts have the potential to disperse fauna among isolated kelp forests; however, the success of this dispersal mechanism will be influenced by the abundance and the dispersal paths of the rafts. The abundance of kelp rafts in the Southern California Eight (SCB) was estimated from the loss of attached plants, and by direct observation of rafts at sea. Loss of attached adult plants was highest in winter (23{\%}) and lowest in fall (8{\%}) at 7 sites within 2 coastal kelp beds over the period of 1988 to 1998. Raft density at sea differed among 4 cruises in the period from 1995 to 1997, and ranged from 0.78 to 6.96 km(-2) (average 3.02 km(-2)). In the SCB these densities correspond to an instantaneous abundance of between 39 000 and 348 000 drifting rafts. The potential raft dispersal paths and the frequency of exchanges among kelp forests were evaluated using satellite-tracked drifters. Southward dispersal away from the coast was observed in all months of the year. Dispersal north, both along the coast and away from the coast, was most likely between July and January (summer-winter), while dispersal south along the coast was likely between January and August (late winter and early spring). A definition of a 'successful connection event' was adopted, based on a drifter starting less than 10 km and ending less than 5 km from the coast. Under this definition, 45{\%} of all drifter releases were successful. Analysis of the temporal pattern and drift trajectories of the mainland-mainland successes revealed that Pt. Conception was always a boundary for north to south connections, but was open to south to north connections between fall and winter (October to January). Drifters released and remaining north or south of Pt. Conception were successful throughout the year. Connections were not made more than 300 km from a release region, under any criteria for success. The results of this study indicate that while rafts may drift long distances, successful connection of kelp forests through kelp rafts is limited to shorter distances.},

abstract = {Subtidal seaweed communities of the northern coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have not been studied before. At Sodwana Bay, we tested the hypotheses that the seaweed communities would (1) differ floristically with depth, (2) be more species-rich in shallower water, (3) show similar biomasses within the depth range sampled and (4) be affected (biomass and/or species composition) by sand. Samples were collected (using SCUBA) from reefs (‘sites') at depths of about 1m, 7m, 10m, 15m and 26m. Each sample comprised all macro- scopic (non-crustose) seaweeds within a 25cm X 25cm quadrat (five quadrats per depth). Environmental factors, including percentage sand cover and depth, were recorded. The seaweed communities were mainly compact turfs; a total of 82 Rhodophyta, 14 Chloro- phyta and eight Phaeophyta were recorded. Ordination (canonical correspondence analysis) and classification (Twinspan) of the data showed clear differences in the floristic composition (either as species biomass or presence/absence) with depth, mainly between shallow subtidal communities (0.5–1.0m depth) and those at intermediate depths (5.5–15.0m), followed by the deepest communities (25.7–29.0m) and those at inter- mediate depths. The shallow samples showed the greatest species diversity. Total seaweed biomass decreased significantly with depth and percentage bare (seaweed-free) substratum increased significantly with depth, possibly because of lower wave action, light penetration, or different grazing patterns. Sand (as percentage sand cover) also affected seaweed commu- nity composition, but this showed no pattern with depth. The algal communities on these reefs at Sod- wana Bay showed exceptional $\alpha$-diversity, with 104 taxa ({\textgreater}20{\%} of the recorded KZN flora) occurring in the total sample area of only 1.56m2 . The seaweed communities of northern KZN are structurally and floristically similar to those of other tropical coral reefs around the world.},

Fifteen morphological characters were measured on individuals from sites of low (2.5 ± 0.8 S.E.) and high (12.2 ± 2.0 S.E.) wave exposure (Baardseth's index) within six locations in southwestern Australia. With the exception of lateral width (P = 0.0001), none of the morphological characters were consistently statistically different (P {\textgreater} 0.06) between high and low wave exposure and correlations with wave exposure were generally weak (r {\textless} 0.60). While 12 of the 15 characters were statistically different (P {\textless} 0.008) between sites of different exposure within at least one location, the direction of difference (significant or not) was opposite between some locations for all but one character (lateral width). ANOSIM was not able to separate thalli from high and low exposure when all locations were pooled (Clarke's R = 0.127), but within each location most sites showed better separation (0.126 {\textless} Clarke's R {\textless} 0.829). Despite the lack of statistical differences, trends suggested that E. radiata responds to exposure by having drag-reducing (small size, narrow laterals and blades, low spinosity) and strength-increasing (relatively large holdfast, thick stipe and thick blades and lamina) morphological traits, as observed for several other kelps in small-scale studies. We conclude that while wave exposure does have an effect on kelp morphology, the effect is not independent of other location-specific processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

On Santa Cruz Island (SCI), CA, USA there is a persistent difference in mean annual sea surface temperature (SST) around the island due to its location at the confluence of opposing cold and warm ocean current systems. Over the course of a 4-year study (1997–2001) seawater nutrient and chl-a concentrations, algal tissue C:N ratios, recruitment and growth of filter-feeders (barnacles and mussels), and intertidal community structure were measured at six intertidal sites around the island. There were strong associations between remotely sensed SST and patterns of community structure. Macrophyte abundance was highest at sites with persistently low SST, while recruitment, abundance, and growth of filter-feeding invertebrates were strongly, positively correlated with SST. The cold-water sites were associated with higher nutrient concentrations and lower algal C:N ratios, particularly in the winter months. Values of chl-a were generally low and variable among sites, and were not correlated with the predominant SST gradient. Recruitment of barnacles and mussels was positively correlated with adult abundance across all sites. While detailed experimental studies are needed to further evaluate the mechanisms underlying community dynamics, these results indicate that the confluence of cold- and warm-water masses around SCI may determine the contrasting patterns of intertidal community structure.},

abstract = {The usefulness and generality of the keystone species concept has recently been questioned. We investigated variation in interaction strength between the original keystone predator, the seastar Pisaster ochra- ceus, and its primary prey, mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus). The study was prompted by differences in community structure at two low zone sites along the central Oregon coast, Boiler Bay (BB) and Strawberry Hill (SH). Predators, especially seastars, were larger and more abundant at SH than at BB. Further, sessile animals were more abundant and macrophytes were less abundant at SH. Predators were more abundant at wave-exposed sites at both sites, and at SH, sessile invertebrates were more abundant at the wave-exposed location and sand cover was high at the wave-protected location. To test the hypothesis that variation in- predation strength explained some of these differences, we examined the seastar-mussel interaction at locations with high and low wave exposure at both sites. Predation intensity was quantified by determining the survival of mussels in clumps (50 mussels per clump, shell length 4-7 cm) transplanted to large plots (18-163 M2) with or without seastars in the low intertidal zone. Predation effects were quantified by determining prey recolonization rates in marked quadrats in the same large plots. Spatial variation in interaction strength was quantified by examining predation at scales of metres (among transplants within plots), 1 0's of metres (between replicate plots within each exposure at each site), 100's of metres (between wave exposures within locations), and 10 000's of metres (between sites). Temporal variation was evaluated by performing the experiments in 1990 and 1991. The relation between prey (mussel) recruitment and growth to differences in community structure was evaluated by quantifying recruitment density in plastic mesh balls (collectors) and growth of individually marked trans- planted mussels, respectively, at each site x exposure x tide level combination each month for 4 yr. Predation intensity varied greatly at all spatial scales. At the two largest spatial scales (10's of kilometres, 100's of metres), differences in both survival of transplanted mussels and prey recolonization depended on variation in seastar abundance with site, wave exposure, prey recruitment and growth, and at SH protected, the extent of sand burial. Variation at the two smallest scales (metres, 10's of metres) was high when seastars were scarce and low when seastars were abundant. Transplanted mussels suffered 100{\%} mortality in 2 wk at wave-exposed SH, but took {\textgreater} 52 wk at wave-protected BB. Seastar effects on prey recolonization were detected only at the SH wave-exposed site. Here, where prey recruitment and growth were unusually high, the mussel M. trossulus invaded and dominated space within 9 mo. After 14 mo, whelks, which increased in both size and abundance in the absence of Pisaster, arrested this increase in mussel abundance. Similar changes did not occur at other site x exposure combinations, evidently because prey recruitment was low and possibly also due to whelk predation on juveniles. Longer term results indicate that, as in Washington state, seastars prevent large adult M. californianus from invading lower intertidal regions, but only at wave-exposed, not wave-protected sites. Thus, three distinct predation regimes were observed: (1) strong keystone predation by seastars at wave- exposed headlands; (2) less-strong diffuse predation by seastars, whelks, and possibly other predators at a wave- protected cove, and (3) weak predation at a wave-protected site buried regularly by sand. Comparable experimental results at four wave-exposed headlands (our two in Oregon and two others in Washington), and similarities between these and communities on other West Coast headlands suggest keystone predation occurs broadly in this system. Results in wave-protected habitats, however, suggest it is not universal. In Oregon, keystone predation was evidently contingent on conditions of high prey production (i.e., recruitment and growth), while diffuse predation occurred when prey production was low, and weak predation occurred when environmental stress was high. Combining our results with examples from other marine and non-marine habitats suggests a need to consider a broader range of models than just keystone predation. The predictive and explanatory value of an expanded set of models depends on identifying factors distinguishing them. Although evidence is limited, a survey of 17 examples suggests (1) keystone predation is evidently not distinguished from diffuse predation by any of 11 previously proposed differences, but (2) may be distinguished by rates of prey production. Further, (3) differential predation on competitively dominant prey does not distinguish keystone from nonkeystone systems, since this interaction occurs in both types of community. Instead, differential predation on dominant prey evidently distinguishes strong-from weak-predation communities. While the key- stone predation concept has been and will continue to be useful, a broadened focus on testing and developing more general models of community regulation is needed},

Giant kelp plants were sampled along a transect in the austral
autumn (May 1986) and late spring (December 1986) which,
according to previous frond weight analysis, were the times when
extremes in population parameters were expected. Plant density
and holdfast wet weights were similar for both seasons, but
plants had more fronds and the fronds weighed more in spring
than in autumn. Consequently, in autumn the frond biomass (1{\textperiodcentered}1
wet kg m?2) and productivity (34{\textperiodcentered}1 wet g m?2 d?1) were lower
than in spring, when a biomass of 5{\textperiodcentered}0 wet kg m?2 and a
productivity of 72{\textperiodcentered}4 wet g m?2 d?1 were recorded. Production of
new fronds and loss of old fronds were determined at monthly
intervals between April 1986 and March 1987. New frond
production rates followed fluctuations in the quantity of light
and varied between 0{\textperiodcentered}08 and 0{\textperiodcentered}48 fronds per plant per day. Frond
loss rates did not show a seasonal pattern and fluctuated
between 0{\textperiodcentered}05 and 0{\textperiodcentered}42 fronds per plant per day. It is suggested
that the Falkland Islands Macrocystis population is more stable
than most other giant kelp beds at high latitudes, because of
the absence of winter storms.},

The plants were grown at 8+/-2 degrees C and 16 h light : 8 h dark cycles with 6 h additional ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure in the middle of the light period. Growth was measured every 10 min using growth chambers with online video measuring technique. Tissue morphology and absorption spectra were measured in untreated young sporophytes while chlorophyll (Chl) a content and DNA damage were measured in treated thalli at the end of the experiment. In all species, growth rates were significantly higher in sporophytes exposed to P alone compared to sporophytes exposed to PAB. Tissue DNA damage is dependent on thallus thickness and absorption spectra characteristics of pigments and UV-absorbing compounds. In sporophytes exposed to UVR, energy demands for repair of DNA damage and synthesis of UV-absorbing compounds for protection effectively diverts photosynthate at the expense of growth. Photosynthetic pigment was not significantly different between treatments suggesting a capacity for acclimation to moderate UVR fluence. The general growth pattern in sporophytes exposed to P alone showed an increasing growth rate from the onset of light (0500-0900 hours) to a peak at the middle of the light phase (0900-1500 hours), a decline towards the end of the light phase (1500-2100 hours) and a minimum "low" growth in the dark (2100-0500 hours) relative to growth during the entire light phase. Under PAB, different growth patterns were observed such as growth compensation at night in L. digitata, delayed growth recovery in L. saccharina and minimal but continuous growth in L. solidungula. Growth as an integrative parameter of all physiological processes showed that the effect of UVR is correlated to the depth distribution of these species.},

abstract = {Passively dispersing propagules are often transported across a
range of scales, with impacts on local processes tied to the
density of settlement, and on regional processes influencing
population connectivity. This dual set of effects has spurred
research targeting both short- and long-distance ends of the
dispersal spectrum. To date, however, dispersal distributions
have been rigorously quantified primarily in terrestrial plants
with seeds. Dispersal distributions in the ocean are by
comparison poorly defined. This limitation arises with particular
force in the habitat-forming giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera,
where complex coastal flows affect self-fertilization and
inbreeding depression near to a source, as well as propagule
delivery dictating recovery of locally extinct populations
farther away. Here we use a combination of theoretical and
experimental approaches to examine spore dispersal in
Macrocystis. Results from a physically based model, parameterized
via field-measured hydrodynamics, are compared to settlement data
gathered at the same experimental site using spore collectors
positioned around solitary kelps and an experimental kelp forest.
Theoretical and empirical findings are synthesized, and the
ability of simple phenomenological expressions to represent
short- and long-distance spore dispersal is examined. Results
demonstrate that short- distance dispersal patterns quantified
over brief durations are noisy due to stochastic effects of
turbulence. Waves can further smear distributions, reducing
distinctions between dispersal from point sources (e.g., solitary
kelps) vs. area sources (e.g., entire forests). Temporally
averaged dispersal distributions follow a lognormal-Gaussian form
that is explicitly coupled to current speed. Analyses based on
this phenomenological expression provide first-order benchmarks
useful in several contexts. Calculations suggest a tremendous
rate of spore release in Macrocystis, exceeding 10(8) spores per
individual per day. Routine fertilization and recruitment appear
possible at distances beyond 1 km from many beds, modulated by
current speed, forest size, and the duration of viability of
gamete-producing life stages derived from spores. Within
Macrocystis forests where settlement densities are high, selfing
levels on the order of 10{\%} or more may arise. These
characteristics influence patterns of propagule supply,
population connectivity, and inbreeding in this key nearshore
seaweed, while also revealing trends in the mechanics of
propagule dispersal more generally.},

abstract = {The probability of successful dispersal by sessile benthic invertebrates is thought to strongly influence their geographic distribution and population genetics. Generally, species with long-lived planktonic larvae are expected to exhibit wider distribution patterns than those species which brood their young, due to their presumably greater potential for dispersal. In some cases, however, brooding species exhibit broad distributions and show evidence of genetic exchange with geographically distant populations. One potential factor that has been invoked as an explanation is dispersal by floating and rafting of adults and egg masses. Several studies have shown that it is possible for sessile adults to disperse on the order of several to many thousand kilometers by rafting on debris in ocean currents. With very few exceptions, however, direct evidence of rafting in the open ocean has been lacking. We present evidence of long-distance (1300 to 2000 km) dispersal of a brooding pelecypod, Gaimardia trapesina (Lamarck, 1819), in the Southern Ocean in the vicinity of Cape Horn, the Falkland Islands, and the antarctic island South Georgia (54{\~{}} 37 {\~{}} W). Data on survival and fecundity rates of G. trapesina and the prevalence of kelp rafts collected during the austral winter of 1993 indicate that dispersal by rafting can occur over ecologically relevant time scales and could potentially serve as a significant means of genetic exchange between populations.},

abstract = {Summary 1.?Climate extremes, such as severe drought, heat waves
and periods of heavy rainfall, can have profound consequences
for ecological systems and for human welfare. Global climate
change is expected to increase both the frequency and the
intensity of climate extremes and there is an urgent need to
understand their ecological consequences. 2.?Major challenges
for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences
of climate extremes include setting a climatic baseline to
facilitate the statistical determination of when climate
conditions are extreme, having sufficient knowledge of
ecological systems so that extreme ecological responses can be
identified, and finally, being able to attribute a climate
extreme as the driver of an extreme ecological response, defined
as an extreme climatic event (ECE). 3.?The papers in this issue
represent a cross-section of the emerging field of climate
extremes research, including an examination of the
palaeo-ecological record to assess patterns and drivers of
extreme ecological responses in the late Quaternary, experiments
in grasslands assessing a range of ecological responses and the
role of ecotypic variation in determining responses to climate
extremes, and the quantification of the ecological consequences
of a recent ECE in the desert Southwest of the USA.
4.?Synthesis. The papers in this Special Feature suggest that
although the occurrence of ECEs may be common in
palaeo-ecological and observational studies, studies in which
climate extremes have been experimentally imposed often do not
result in ecological responses outside the bounds of normal
variability of a system. Thus, ECEs occur much less frequently
than their potential drivers and even less frequently than
observational studies suggest. Future research is needed to
identify the types and time-scales of climate extremes that
result in ECEs, the potential for interactions among different
types of climate changes and extremes, and the role of genetic,
species and trait diversity in determining ecological responses
and their evolutionary consequences. These research priorities
require the development of alternative research approaches to
impose realistic climate extremes on a broad range of organisms
and ecosystems.},

abstract = {The deep sea, the largest ecosystem on Earth and one of the least studied, harbours high biodiversity and provides a wealth of resources. Although humans have used the oceans for millennia, technological developments now allow exploitation of fisheries resources, hydrocarbons and minerals below 2000 m depth. The remoteness of the deep seafloor has promoted the disposal of residues and litter. Ocean acidification and climate change now bring a new dimension of global effects. Thus the challenges facing the deep sea are large and accelerating, providing a new imperative for the science community, industry and national and international organizations to work together to develop successful exploitation management and conservation of the deep-sea ecosystem. This paper provides scientific expert judgement and a semi-quantitative analysis of past, present and future impacts of human-related activities on global deep-sea habitats within three categories: disposal, exploitation and climate change. The analysis is the result of a Census of Marine Life--SYNDEEP workshop (September 2008). A detailed review of known impacts and their effects is provided. The analysis shows how, in recent decades, the most significant anthropogenic activities that affect the deep sea have evolved from mainly disposal (past) to exploitation (present). We predict that from now and into the future, increases in atmospheric CO(2) and facets and consequences of climate change will have the most impact on deep-sea habitats and their fauna. Synergies between different anthropogenic pressures and associated effects are discussed, indicating that most synergies are related to increased atmospheric CO(2) and climate change effects. We identify deep-sea ecosystems we believe are at higher risk from human impacts in the near future: benthic communities on sedimentary upper slopes, cold-water corals, canyon benthic communities and seamount pelagic and benthic communities. We finalise this review with a short discussion on protection and management methods.},

their seed banks. The seed bank strategies of the grasses from

conducted an experiment to observe the dormancy release
characteristics of 3 grasses common to these environments when
stored under contrasting thermal regimes. The grasses studied
were great brome grass (Bromus diandrus Roth), annual ryegrass

Link). The different species displayed contrasting dormancy
release characteristics over the summer. Two of the species
examined (great brome grass and annual ryegrass) displayed
relatively late release from dormancy which gave high levels of
protection from false breaks. The other (barley grass) displayed
earlier release from dormancy which would enable it to better
exploit earlier true breaks but make it more sensitive to false
breaks. Unlike pasture legumes, high and fluctuating temperatures
were not necessary for the seeds of these grasses to become
germinable. In fact, exposure to high temperatures appeared more
likely to suppress release from dormancy.},

Abundant macroalgal drift was found in the Carmel Submarine Canyon (153454-m depth) but was rare at Pt. Joe, a continental shelf habitat 9 km away (87-357-m depth). Most of the drift parcels consisted of brown algae, but 10 other categories were found, including green and red algae and the surfgrass Phyllospadix spp. M. pyrifera drift accounted for as much as 20{\%} of the density of drift parcels in the Carmel Submarine Canyon, and up to 50{\%} of the drift parcels at Pt. Joe. From previously determined turnover rates of drift M. pyrifera and the standing stock estimates from the present study, we estimated that the rate of carbon flux associated with drift M. pyrifera to the benthos of the Carmel Submarine Canyon was 45.2 mg C m-2 d-1. Based on published estimates of carbon flux from vertically sinking particulate organic carbon at 400-m depth in the nearby Monterey Submarine Canyon, and our estimates of kelp-derived carbon flux, drift M. pyrifera can account for 20-83{\%} of the total particulate organic carbon reaching the sea floor in the Carmel Submarine Canyon. We conclude that drift macrophytes provide significant enrichment of organic carbon to the benthos above that provided by vertically sinking particulate organic material. The extent to which this alters the structure of benthic communities compared to areas without organic enrichment by drift macrophytes remains unknown and awaits further study.},
annote = {{\textgreater} In the submarine canyon in this study, it was found that macroalgal drift provided a predictable source of nutrition for A. fragilis, which allowed a higher reproductive condition than conspecifics at the nearby shelf habitat where drift macrophytes provided significant enrichment of organic carbon to the benthos above that provided by the vertical flux associated with detrital rain. 

{\textgreater} Thus , laterally transported macroalgal drift nearshore kelp forests may play a more important role in the flux of organic carbon to deep-sea environments than previously recognised. This may partially explain the descrepancy between carbon flux and carbon demand of the benthos recently reported for the continental margin deep-sea habitats. Carbon flux estimates from particle traps do not account for laterally advected macroalagal drift, which may be a quantitatively important process in coastal habitats.},

abstract = {Little is known about the cumulative effects of multiple ({\textgreater}2)
environmental controls on species performance and interactions in
aquatic ecosystems. We asked how changes in climatic
(temperature, ultraviolet radiation) and ecological controls
(nutrients, grazing) affect recruitment of the green macroalga
Enteromorpha intestinalis, which forms destructive algal blooms
in coastal ecosystems worldwide. We designed factorial laboratory
experiments to analyze the recruitment response to (1) single and
combined effects of nutrient enrichment, grazing pressure, and
grazer species composition and (2) the cumulative effects of
ultraviolet (UV) radiation, temperature, nutrients, and grazing.
Recruitment of E. intestinalis increased exponentially with
nutrient enrichment. Grazers could control algal recruitment
until a nutrient threshold was reached depending on grazer
species composition. Snails (Littorina littorea) had strong
negative effects on recruit density, whereas amphipods (Gammarus
oceanicus) had weak grazing effects and favored algal recruitment
through excretion when nutrient supply was low. Temperature and
nutrients both enhanced algal recruitment but also the effects of
grazers, which led to a significant three-way interaction among
these factors. Similarly, effects of UV radiation depended on
grazer presence and temperature. When grazers were absent, UV
radiation reduced recruitment at 11 and 17°C but enhanced
recruitment at 5°C. No effects were seen in the presence of
grazers. Our results indicate that multiple human influences,
such as climate change, eutrophication, and food web alterations,
have interdependent effects and the potential for synergistically
enhancing the development of macroalgal blooms in coastal
ecosystems.},

abstract = {Species are the unit of analysis in many global change and conservation biology studies; however, species are not uniform entities but are composed of different, sometimes locally adapted, popula-tions differing in plasticity. We examined how intraspecific variation in thermal niches and pheno-typic plasticity will affect species distributions in a warming climate. We first developed a conceptual model linking plasticity and niche breadth, providing five alternative intraspecific sce-narios that are consistent with existing literature. Secondly, we used ecological niche-modeling techniques to quantify the impact of each intraspecific scenario on the distribution of a virtual species across a geographically realistic setting. Finally, we performed an analogous modeling exercise using real data on the climatic niches of different tree provenances. We show that when population differentiation is accounted for and dispersal is restricted, forecasts of species range shifts under climate change are even more pessimistic than those using the conventional assump-tion of homogeneously high plasticity across a species' range. Suitable population-level data are not available for most species so identifying general patterns of population differentiation could fill this gap. However, the literature review revealed contrasting patterns among species, urging greater levels of integration among empirical, modeling and theoretical research on intraspecific phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Abstract Tide gauges remain the fundamental instrument used to
measure water level in the coastal environment. Issues
surrounding the calibration and vertical datum control of tide
gauges are therefore fundamental in studies involving the
determination of absolute sea level and its variation over time.
Macquarie Island, located in Australian sub-Antarctic waters
(54°30? S, 158°57? E), represents one of the few possible
locations in the Southern Ocean to observe sea level using
traditional tide gauge techniques. The wave and atmospheric
climatology of the region, coupled with a rugged coastline,
makes the operation of a modern tide gauge installation
extremely difficult. To overcome many of these difficulties,
researchers use an acoustic gauge operated within an inclined
shaft that is drilled through a coastal rocky outcrop. The
calibration requirements of the gauge are therefore problematic
and require special consideration to enable the accurate
calculation of mean sea level and its change over time. We
present results from a novel application of a GPS-equipped buoy
to achieve an in situ calibration of the tide gauge, solving for
scale, vertical offset, and sea state?dependent bias parameters.
The methodology provides a new, high precision technique using
available instrumentation, allowing users to maximise the
oceanographic and geodetic value of tide gauge observations.},

abstract = {Similar environmental driving forces can produce similarity among geographically distant ecosystems. Coastal oceanic upwelling, for example, has been associated with elevated biomass and abundance patterns of certain functional groups, e.g., corticated macroalgae. In the upwelling system of Northern Chile, we examined measures of intertidal macro- benthic composition, structure and trophic ecology across eighteen shores varying in their proximity to two coastal upwelling centres, in a hierarchical sampling design (spatial scales of {\textgreater}1 and {\textgreater}10 km). The influence of coastal upwelling on intertidal communities was con- firmed by the stable isotope values ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) of consumers, including a dominant suspension feeder, grazers, and their putative resources of POM, epilithic biofilm, and macroalgae.We highlight the utility of muscle $\delta$15N from the suspension feeding mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, as a proxy for upwelling, supported by satellite data and previous studies. Where possible, we used corrections for broader-scale trends, spatial autocorrela- tion, ontogenetic dietary shifts and spatial baseline isotopic variation prior to analysis. Our results showed macroalgal assemblage composition, and benthic consumer assemblage structure, varied significantly with the intertidal influence of coastal upwelling, especially contrasting bays and coastal headlands. Coastal topography also separated differences in consumer resource use. This suggested that coastal upwelling, itself driven by coastline topography, influences intertidal communities by advecting nearshore phytoplankton popu- lations offshore and cooling coastal water temperatures.We recommend the isotopic val- ues of benthic organisms, specifically long-lived suspension feeders, as in situ alternatives to offshore measurements of upwelling influence.},

abstract = {We describe a model for the evolutionary consequences of plasticity in an environmentally heterogeneous metapopulation in which specialists for each of two alternative environments and one plastic type are initially present. The model is similar to that proposed by Moran (1992) but extends her work to two sites. We show that with migration between sites the plastic type is favored over local specialists across a broad range of parameter space. The plastic type may dominate or be fixed even in an environmentally uniform site, and even if the plasticity has imperfect accuracy or bears some cost such that a local specialist has higher fitness in that site, as long as there is some migration between sites with different distributions of environmental states. These results suggest that differences among taxa in dispersal and hence realized migration rates may play a here- tofore unrecognized role in their patterns of adaptive population differentiation. Migration relaxes the thresholds for both environ- mental heterogeneity and accuracy of plastic response above which plasticity is favored. Furthermore, small changes in response accuracy can dramatically and abruptly alter the evolutionary outcome in the metapopulation. A fitness cost to plasticity will substantially reduce the range of conditions in which the plastic type will prevail only if the cost is both large and global rather than environment specific},

@article{Odonoghue,
abstract = {Introduction South Africa is the custodian of a marine and coastal environ-ment that is remarkable for its beauty, biotic diversity, and geomorphological features. By its very nature, the coast contrib-utes substantially to the economy of the country, primarily through the fertile adjacent farmlands, its cities, ports and holiday resorts, as well as through the harvesting of marine resources and products. It is estimated that at least 35{\%} of South Africa's gross domestic product is generated in the coastal regions. 1 Recent years have seen an influx of people to the coast, and current estimates are that one-third of the population resides within 60 km of the seashore. 1 This places environmental pressure on the coastal systems, inevitably increasing the threat of their degradation, including that relating to pollution. The implementation of management procedures necessary to reduce the effects of pollution should be based on sound scientific principles. The primary objective of the study reported here was to assess the scientific basis for marine pollution monitoring in South Africa, and thereby to decide whether research on the ecological effects of marine pollution is adequate and appropriate. Pollution-monitoring projects currently being undertaken in South Africa are extremely diverse in their objectives and practice. By far the majority are linked to impact assessment studies by local authorities (municipalities) or private consul-tants, to meet town and regional planning requirements. Other consultancies concern local industries, or port authorities, in order to meet state requirements, or international protocols, such as the London Convention. 2 These types of projects are often narrowly focused. In considering immediate issues using standard procedures, their contextual frameworks limit inter-pretation of data, and their objectives contribute little to the development of scientific and technological knowledge. Globally, pollution studies have been at the forefront of marine biological research in recent years. Pollution monitoring in marine environments is underpinned by a growing body of theoretical science. The methods are subject to continual refine-ment, inevitably allowing greater accessibility of information on, and better understanding of, pollutant effects. 3,4 While the theory may be broadly applicable, much of the application relates to local circumstances, hence the need for local research initiatives to account for the considerable variability in effects relating to different geographical (temperatures, ocean currents) and ecological (taxa and communities) conditions. 5 Although the South Africa's inshore environment is thought to be largely pristine, this impression has never been substantiated, and comprehensive data on how pollutants vary in time and space remain unavailable. Furthermore, we know very little about the general ecological implications of local pollution events, specifi-cally, how harbour extinctions may affect regional populations. The apparent neglect of scientific investigation of marine pollution, in recent times, is surprising considering South Africa's strong marine biological research culture. 6,7 The current study explores this supposition, specifically assessing the ade-quacy and appropriateness of recent marine pollution research endeavours. We examine research trends over the past forty years, based on analyses of the primary literature, and include a bibliography. Methods Primary data were drawn from published work (mainly journal articles) concerning marine pollution from studies undertaken in South Africa between 1960 and the present day. Unpublished reports, including numerous investigations by environmental consultants (private and otherwise), were omit-ted from this analysis for two reasons. Many of these reports are not accessible to the public at large, and are generally not relevant to the objective of evaluating the development of scien-tific research and technology. While the focus of the study was on biological organisms (animals, plants and microbes) and ecological effects, the analyses incorporated all the published scientific papers retrieved (including non-biological ones). The latter were not considered for discussion. The South African National Research Programme Reports, published by the Foundation for Research Development, however, are generally available to the public and are included in the bibliography. The search engines used were Web of Science, ScienceDirect, OCLC First Search and EBSCO. Keywords included combina-tions of the following terms: marine, estuarine, coast, pollution, South Africa, sewage, organic, bacteria, coliforms, chemical, industrial, oil, petroleum, hydrocarbon, DDT, dieldrin, PCB, organochlorine, metal, cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, tin, sediment, radioactive, nuclear, thermal, plastic, litter, outfall, stormwater, bioaccumulation, biomonitoring, bioindication and ecotoxicology. Wildcard characters with truncated keywords enabled the capture of variations of the above keywords. The basic information recorded for each article included: (1) the year in which the article was published, (2) the region where the study was undertaken, and (3) the nature of the investiga-tion, including the type of pollutant being investigated. In order to present the data as a time-frequency distribution, each article was grouped into a five-year class. Distinction was made between investigations undertaken in response to a crisis, such as an oil spill (reactive), and those independently motivated. Reactive studies were considered only in the initial temporal analysis and were excluded from other data sets. Regions were defined according to the political demarcations of the three coastal provinces, the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and},

abstract = {Most climate projections suggest that sea level may rise on the
order of 0.5–1.0 m by 2100; it is not clear, however, how fluid
flow and sediment dynamics on exposed fringing reefs might
change in response to this rapid sea-level rise. Coupled
hydrodynamic and sediment-transport numerical modeling is
consistent with recent published results that suggest that an
increase in water depth on the order of 0.5–1.0 m on a 1–2 m
deep exposed fringing reef flat would result in larger
significant wave heights and setup, further elevating water
depths on the reef flat. Larger waves would generate higher
near-bed shear stresses, which, in turn, would result in an
increase in both the size and the quantity of sediment that can
be resuspended from the seabed or eroded from adjacent coastal
plain deposits. Greater wave- and wind-driven currents would
develop with increasing water depth, increasing the alongshore
and offshore flux of water and sediment from the inner reef flat
to the outer reef flat and fore reef where coral growth is
typically greatest. Sediment residence time on the fringing reef
flat was modeled to decrease exponentially with increasing
sea-level rise as the magnitude of sea-level rise approached the
mean water depth over the reef flat. The model results presented
here suggest that a 0.5–1.0 m rise in sea level will likely
increase coastal erosion, mixing and circulation, the amount of
sediment resuspended, and the duration of high turbidity on
exposed reef flats, resulting in decreased light availability
for photosynthesis, increased sediment-induced stress on the
reef ecosystem, and potentially affecting a number of other
ecological processes.},

This study describes the structure of subtidal assemblages of epibiota among pilings, pontoons and adjacent rocky reef in Sydney Harbour, Australia. I tested the prediction that the experimental provision of substrata of the same age and composition in all three habitats would produce assemblages that: (1) differed among all three habitats; and (2) differed most on floating pontoons relative to the two fixed habitats (pilings and reef). As predicted, the results suggested that both pilings and pontoons, particularly the latter, create novel habitats for epibiotic assemblages independent of age and composition of substratum. It is not fully understood why these urban structures act as such different habitats from natural rocky reefs. The important point is that they are different and we are yet to understand the implications of this for the ecology of coastal areas subject to urbanisation.

abstract = {Floating seaweeds are important dispersal vehicles for many
organisms in cold-temperate waters between latitudes 30° and
60°. Molecular studies suggested that long-distance rafting of
seaweeds is more prevalent at the polar edges of their
distribution but knowledge about their physiological status at
high latitudes is limited. Seasonal short-term field experiments
were conducted along a latitudinal gradient (30°, 37° and 54°S)
with floating kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Durvillaea
antarctica. Kelps were tethered at the sea surface for 14d
during austral winter and summer to examine their acclimation
potential in floating conditions. Biomass changes, reproductive
status and physiological traits (chlorophyll a fluorescence,
pigments, phlorotannins and antioxidant capacity) were evaluated
after 7d and 14d of floating. Biomass changes (positive or
negative) depended on species and latitude: at low latitudes
(Coquimbo) both species lost biomass during both seasons while
at mid latitudes (Concepci{\'{o}}n) they grew during summer but not in
winter. Species-specific responses were observed at high
latitudes (Pta. Arenas) with floating M. pyrifera growing in
summer and D. antarctica in winter. Both species were able to
maintain reproductive status mainly in winter, but at mid
latitudes M. pyrifera also showed high reproductive activity
during summer. Physiological adjustment was detected for both
species at day 7 and upheld until the end of the experiment
(14d). Latitudinal changes in photosynthetic variables (maximum
quantum yield and pigments) were more evident in summer
conditions, M. pyrifera showing decreases in Fv/Fm and pigment
levels at low and high latitudes while in D. antarctica these
variables increased with latitude. Phlorotannin contents varied
with latitude but showed an opposing pattern in the two kelp
species, with high concentrations at low latitudes for M.
pyrifera and at high latitudes for D. antarctica. The floating
kelps maintained high antioxidant capacity during the
experiments. The short-term acclimation responses support the
hypothesis of long-distance dispersal at high latitudes for both
floating kelp species. The acclimation potential differed
between the two species depending on the season, especially at
mid and high latitudes. Summer conditions were favorable for
floating M. pyrifera at high latitudes and for both species at
mid latitudes in which a combination of increasing radiation and
moderate temperature can stimulate growth. The results confirm
that kelp rafting is favored at mid/high latitudes but suggest
that in polar waters ({\textgreater}60°) low temperatures and light
limitations might suppress growth of floating seaweeds.},

abstract = {Intra-specific morphological variability is common among many
species of plants, and is particularly common among marine algae.
Populations of the kelp Egregia menziesii (Turner) Areschoug are
known to be extremely variable in form, and variability in this
species is well-correlated with geographical distribution.
Populations north of Point Conception, California, are
characterized by individuals having thick, tough, wide stipes and
small blades, whereas populations south of Point Conception are
characterized by individuals having thin, smooth stipes and large
blades. Point Conception (hereafter PC) is a well-known
biogeographic boundary for many marine species. The region north
of PC is typified by cold, nutrient-rich water favorable to plant
growth, but also by high wave exposure, increasing the likelihood
of plant breakage or dislodgement. The region south of PC is
characterized by warmer, oligotrophic water (less favorable for
plant growth), but the potential for plant breakage or
dislodgment is low due to the calm seas in this region. Using
reciprocal transplant experiments, we examined the potential
adaptive value of the morphologies of both populations (northern
and southern) in the light of these physical gradients among
sites north and south of PC, and the tradeoff between rapid
growth and increased risk of breakage. We reciprocally
transplanted northern- and southern-form E. menziesii among
several sites north and south of PC and monitored size and
survival of each individual over a 5 mo period. In general, both
survival and growth of the northern form was greatest at the
northern sites, and southern form survival and growth was
greatest at the southern sites. Overall, growth was greatest at
the northern sites, and the greatest increase in size was
achieved by a southern-form individual at a northern site. These
results indicate that regionally specific morphological forms of
E. menziesii seem to be uniquely adapted to maximize growth and
survival under conditions typical of their native region.
However, in the absence of breakage, southern-form E. menziesii
have the potential to grow large under northern conditions.
Northern-form E. menziesii have a reduced probability of breakage
or dislodgment due to their high-strength, low-drag morphology.
Southern-form E. menziesii have much lower breaking strengths and
higher drag than northern forms, but have a higher surface area
per unit of stipe, potentially advantageous for nutrient uptake
in the low-nutrient environment south of Point Conception.
Although these morphological forms appear to be advantageous
within each of these regions, it remains to be explored whether
their morphology can be altered at an early life stage or whether
it is genetically fixed.},

abstract = {Decreases in the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere are predicted to result in more biologically damaging ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) reaching the Earth's surface in the near future. The consequences for plant life of this small change in the solar spectrum are currently uncertain; this is particularly true for aquatic macrophytic algae. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of UVBR effects on macrophytes, and to highlight areas for future research. An overview of published underwater UVBR measurements shows that penetration of this waveband is low in the coastal waters where most macroalgae are found. Knowledge of UVBR targets in macroalgae is poor, and biological weighting functions have yet to be established. Studies of higher plants and phytoplankton are used to illustrate the many possible targets and effects of UVBR. The role of photosynthetically active radiation in causing dynamic and chronic photoinhibition in macroalgae and the interactions of PAR with UVR are examined in detail. These interactions are central to interpretation of field measurements of photoinhibition under natural solar radiation conditions. Potential strategies and mechanisms for repair of UVBR damage are discussed. Before the long-term effects of UVBR on macroalgal production and community structure can be determined, a greater knowledge of the specific targets of UVBR in macrophytes and the mechanisms of protection and repair must be determined. The ability of macrophytes to acclimate to higher UVBR and the interaction of UVBR with other stresses, such as high PAR, temperature and desiccation, must be assessed. Studies are needed which encompass effects on all stages of the macrophyte life cycle, from recruitment to maturity.},

abstract = {* The use of fluid lensing technology on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) is presented as a novel means for 3D imaging of aquatic ecosystems from above the water's surface at the centimetre scale. Preliminary results are presented from airborne fluid lensing campaigns conducted over the coral reefs of Ofu Island, American Samoa (2013) and the stromatolite reefs of Shark Bay, Western Australia (2014), covering a combined area of 15 km2. These reef ecosystems were revealed with centimetre-scale 2D resolution, and an accompanying 3D bathymetry model was derived using fluid lensing, Structure from Motion and UAV position data. Data products were validated from in situ survey methods including underwater calibration targets, depth measurements and millimetre-scale high-dynamic-range gigapixel photogrammetry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Fluid lensing is an experimental technology that uses water-transmitting wavelengths to passively image underwater objects at high-resolution by exploiting time-varying optical lensing events caused by surface waves. Fluid lensing data are captured from low-altitude, cost-effective electric UAVs to achieve multispectral imagery and bathymetry models at the centimetre scale over regional areas. As a passive system, fluid lensing is presently limited by signal-to-noise ratio and water column inherent optical properties to {\~{}}10 m depth over visible wavelengths in clear waters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* The datasets derived from fluid lensing present the first centimetre-scale images of a reef acquired from above the ocean surface, without wave distortion. The 3D multispectral data distinguish coral, fish and invertebrates in American Samoa, and reveal previously undocumented, morphologically distinct, stromatolite structures in Shark Bay. These findings suggest fluid lensing and multirotor electric drones represent a promising advance in the remote sensing of aquatic environments at the centimetre scale, or ‘reef scale' relevant to the conservation of reef ecosystems. Pending further development and validation of fluid lensing methods, these technologies present a solution for large-scale 3D surveys of shallow aquatic habitats with centimetre-scale spatial resolution and hourly temporal sampling.$\backslash$nCopyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Multiscale patterns of spatial and temporal variation in density and population structure were used to evaluate the generality of a three—trophic—level cascade among sea otters (Enhydra lutris), invertebrate herbivores, and macroalgae in Alaska. The paradigm holds that where sea otters occur herbivores are rare and plants are abundant, whereas when sea otters are absent herbivores are relatively common and plants are rare. Spatial patterns were based on 20 randomly placed quadrats at 153 randomly selected sites distributed among five locations with and four locations without sea otters. Both sea urchin and kelp abundance differed significantly among locations with vs. without sea otters in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska. There was little (Aleutian Islands) or no (southeast Alaska) overlap between sites with and without sea otters, in plots of kelp density against urchin biomass. Despite intersite variation in the abundance of kelps and herbivores, these analyses demonstrate that sea otter predation has a predictable and broadly generalizable influence on the structure of Alaskan kelp forests. The percent cover of algal turf and suspension feeder assemblages also differed significantly (although less dramatically) between locations with and without sea otters. Temporal variation in community structure was assessed over periods of from 3 to 15 yr at sites in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska where sea otters were 1) continuously present, 2) continuously absent, or 3) becoming reestablished because of natural range expansion. Kelp and sea urchin abundance remained largely unchanged at most sites where sea otters were continuously present or absent, the one exception being at Torch Bay (southeast Alaska), where kelp abundance varied significantly through time and urchin abundance varied significantly among sites because of episodic and patchy disturbances. In contrast, kelp and sea urchin abundances changed significantly, and in the expected directions, at sites that were being recolonized by sea otters. Sea urchin biomass declined by 50{\%} in the Aleutian Islands and by nearly 100{\%} in southeast Alaska following the spread of sea otters into previously unoccupied habitats. In response to these different rates and magnitudes of urchin reduction by sea otter predation, increases in kelp abundance were abrupt and highly significant in southeast Alaska but much smaller and slower over similar time periods in the Aleutian Islands. The different kelp colonization rates between southeast Alaska and the Aleutian Islands appear to be caused by large—scale differences in echinoid recruitment coupled with size—selective predation by sea otters for larger urchins. The length of urchin jaws (correlated with test diameter, r2 = 0.968) in sea otter scats indicates that sea urchins {\textless}15—20 mm test diameter are rarely eaten by foraging sea otters. Sea urchin populations in the Aleutian Islands included high densities of small individuals ({\textless}20 mm test diameter) at all sites and during all years sampled, whereas in southeast Alaska similarly sized urchins were absent from most populations during most years. Small ({\textless}30—35 mm test diameter) tetracycline—marked urchins in the Aleutian Islands grew at a maximum rate of °10 mm/yr; thus the population must have significant recruitment annually, or at least every several years. In contrast, echinoid recruitment in southeast Alaska was more episodic, with many years to perhaps decades separating significant events. Our findings help explain regional differences in recovery rates of kelp forests following recolonization by sea otters.},

abstract = {Using field and laboratory experiments, we investigated the relative ability of zygotes of three species of habitat-forming large brown algae from southern New Zealand to survive wave action and remain attached after settling times of 1, 6, and 12 h. Zygotes of Hormosira banksii (Turner) Decaisne and Cystophora torulosa (R. Brown) J. Agardh, intertidal algae common on sheltered and semi-protected shores in southern New Zealand, had between 24{\%} and 35{\%} survival 1 h after settlement and exposed to a single wave in the lab and field. In contrast, Durvillaea antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot, an exposed-shore species, had up to 75{\%} survival under the same conditions. Survival increased with post-settlement time for all three species. When given 6 h to attach under the same conditions, the survival of Hormosira and Cystophora zygotes ranged between 50{\%} and 60{\%} and between 80{\%} and 90{\%} when given 12 h to attach. Durvillaea, in contrast, had between 90{\%} and 100{\%} survival at both 6- and 12-h setting times. In other experiments, H. banksii and D. antarctica zygotes were given either 1, 6, or 12 h to attach and then placed for 12 h into sites within three levels of wave exposure (sheltered, intermediate and exposed). Survival of Hormosira zygotes given 1 and 6 h to attach was poor, ranging from 1{\%} to 8{\%}. If given 12 h to set, however, 5-8{\%} of Hormosira zygotes survived, even at the exposed sites. Under similar conditions, Durvillaea survival was significantly higher, ranging from 70{\%} to 100{\%} at all post-settlement times, in sites of all exposures. Wave action clearly affects the ability of sheltered shore species to settle in exposed sites. However, our study highlights the importance of factors other than wave action in determining the distribution and abundance of post-settlement stages of D. antarctica across exposures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Over the centuries, land reclamation, coastal development, overfishing and pollution have nearly eliminated European wetlands, seagrass meadows, shellfish beds, biogenic reefs and other productive and diverse coastal habitats. It is estimated that every day between 1960 and 1995, a kilometre of European coastline was developed. Most countries have estimated losses of coastal wetlands and seagrasses exceeding 50{\%} of the original area with peaks above 80{\%} for many regions. Conspicuous declines, sometimes to virtual local disappearance of kelps and other complex macro- algae, have been observed in several countries. A few dominant threats have led to these losses over time. The greatest impacts to wetlands have consistently been land claim and coastal devel- opment. The greatest impacts to seagrasses and macroalgae are presently associated with degraded water quality while in the past there have been more effects from destructive fishing and diseases. Coastal development remains an important threat to seagrasses. For biogenic habitats, such as oyster reefs and maerls, some of the greatest impacts have been from destructive fishing and overexploi- tation with additional impacts of disease, particularly to native oysters. Coastal development and defence have had the greatest known impacts on soft-sediment habitats with a high likelihood that trawling has affected vast areas. The concept of ‘shifting baselines', which has been applied mostly to the inadequate historical perspective of fishery losses, is extremely relevant for habitat loss more generally. Most habitat loss estimates refer to a relatively short time span primarily within the last century. However, in some regions, most estuarine and near-shore coastal habitats were already severely degraded or driven to virtual extinction well before 1900. Native oyster reefs were ecologically extinct by the 1950s along most European coastlines and in many bays well before that. These shellfish reefs are among the most endangered coastal habitats, but they receive some of the least protection. Nowadays less than 15{\%} of the European coastline is considered in ‘good' condition. Those fragments of native habitats that remain are under continued threat, and their management is not generally informed by adequate knowledge of their distribution and status. There are many policies and directives aimed at reducing and reversing these losses but their overall positive benefits have been low. Further neglecting this long history of habitat loss and transfor- mation may ultimately compromise the successful management and future sustainability of those few fragments of native and semi-native coastal habitats that remain in Europe.},

abstract = {This paper integrates long-term descriptive and experimental studies of the effects of ocean climate on inter- and intraspecific competition, as expressed by recruitment, density, survivorship, growth, and reproduction of the most conspicuous kelp species in the Point Loma kelp forest community off San Diego, California, USA. The species included Macrocystis pyrifera, with a floating canopy; Pterygophora californica and Eisenia arborea, which rely on stipes to support their canopy; Laminaria farlowii, with a prostrate canopy; and a speciose red algal turf. To evaluate the roles of large-scale oceanographic processes on biological processes across important depth gradients, the study was carried out over nine years during a cold-water, nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a event (1988–1989) and a warm-water, nutrient-stressed El Nin ˜o period (1992–1994), over a depth range of 8–23 m. This depth range encompassed strong physical gradients involving factors that are critical for kelp growth, including bottom temperatures (correlated with nutrients) and light levels. To examine interactions among these kelps, we established clearings across the depth gradient and then manipulated Macrocystis recruit densities. The demographic responses offer an understanding of the ‘‘fundamental'' vs. ‘‘realized'' niches of these species. Eval- uating these patterns, as they are influenced by inter- and intraspecific competition, offers insights into the ‘‘realized niches'' of the kelps. With the exception of some understory effects on Macrocystis recruitment and some evidence of intraspecific competition during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a conditions, we found little influence of competitive effects on Macrocystis. The response of Pterygophora to manipulations and disturbances suggests light-limited recruitment, and competition with Macrocystis was exhibited via reduced growth and reproduction, but not survivorship. No nutrient stress was observed in Ptery- gophora reproduction. Eisenia recruitment is rare, but once established, juveniles had very good survivorship, with growth and reproduction reduced by depth; the Macrocystis treat- ment was more important than depth, suggesting the importance of light to Eisenia re- cruitment and growth. In general, Macrocystis had massive effects on Laminaria growth and reproduction, the strength varying with depth. In particular, there were very strong effects of competition with Macrocystis during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a period when Macrocystis had a dense surface canopy. In addition to the Macrocystis effects, there were some significant Pterygophora effects on Laminaria growth during El Nin ˜o. The strongest biological definition of realized niches occurred during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a period, especially in shallow depths. One of the most important conclusions of this paper is the appreciation of the importance of scaling in time to include oceanographic climate. There are many seasonal patterns, but the interannual scales that encompass El Nin ˜os and La Nin ˜as, and ultimately the interdecadal-scale oceanographic regime shifts that affect the intensity of canopy competition with Macrocystis, are critical for this system because surface-water nutrients have pervasive long-term effects on the other kelps. Small- scale patterns are driven by local processes (competition, disturbance, dispersal, etc.) that potentially are important at larger scales; however, our most lasting effects result from very large-scale, low-frequency episodic changes in nutrients, with cascading competitive con- sequences to the other algal populations in the community.

abstract = {Floating objects facilitate the dispersal of marine and
terrestrial species but also represent a major environmental
hazard in the case of anthropogenic plastic litter. They can be
found throughout the world's oceans but information on their
abundance and the spatio-temporal dynamics is scarce for many
regions of the world. This information, however, is essential to
evaluate the ecological role of floating objects. Herein, we
report the results from a ship-based visual survey on the
abundance and composition of flotsam in the German Bight (North
Sea) during the years 2006 to 2008. The aim of this study was to
identify potential sources of floating objects and to relate
spatio-temporal density variations to environmental conditions.
Three major flotsam categories were identified: buoyant seaweed
(mainly fucoid brown algae), natural wood and anthropogenic
debris. Densities of these floating objects in the German Bight
were similar to those reported from other coastal regions of the
world. Temporal variations in flotsam densities are probably the
result of seasonal growth cycles of seaweeds and fluctuating
river runoff (wood). Higher abundances were often found in areas
where coastal fronts and eddies develop during calm weather
conditions. Accordingly, flotsam densities were often higher in
the inner German Bight than in areas farther offshore. Import of
floating objects and retention times in the German Bight are
influenced by wind force and direction. Our results indicate
that a substantial amount of floating objects is of coastal
origin or introduced into the German Bight from western source
areas such as the British Channel. Rapid transport of floating
objects through the German Bight is driven by strong westerly
winds and likely facilitates dispersal of associated organisms
and gene flow among distant populations.},

challenge for landscape genetics is to address the spread of
adaptive variation across landscapes. Genome scans combined with
genetic sample collection along environmental gradients or in
different habitat types attempt to identify molecular markers
that are statistically related to specific environmental
conditions, indicating adaptive genetic variation. The landscape

under the influence of anthropogenic activities. A number of key
changes in the earths atmosphere and ocean have already been
detected (including increasing global surface temperature,
rising sea levels, increases in incident UV radiation, changes
in average annual precipitation, and increases in the
variability and intensity of extreme weather events, among

greenhouse gases with observed and future projected changes in
the earth's climate, specifically in respect of a number of key
atmospheric and oceanographic parameters likely to affect fish
stocks in South Africa (temperature, pressure/wind fields, CO2
concentration, rainfall, mean sea level and UV radiation). It
also explores likely effects of these changes on fish stocks and
key fishery sectors. In addition, it highlights a number of
positive steps that be taken by management authorities to ensure
that they and the fishing communities for which they are

This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

The transport is driven by pressure gradients (A P I 3 Pa) generated when bottom flows (u I 10 cm s-l) are deflected by small surface structures (z {\textless} 3 cm) of hydrodynamical or biological origin. Acrylic pigment grains of 1 - and 1 O-pm diameter traced the intrusion of particulate matter into sandy sediment (k {\textgreater} 2 x 10-l l m2) incubated in a laboratory flume. Increased pressure up- and downstream of small mounds (z = 2.5 cm) drove water 5.5 cm into the core, carrying suspended particles (1 pm) to 2.2-cm sediment depth within 10 h. Simultaneously, decreased pressure at the downstream slope of the protrusions drew pore fluid from deeper layers (z 5 10 cm) to the surface. In the sediment, friction reduced the velocity of the particulate tracers, resulting in size fractionation and layers of increased particle concentration. Ripple topography (0.8-2.8 cm high) enhanced interfacial particle (1 pm) flux by a factor 2 .3 when compared to a level control core. The pathways of the particle and solute tracers below a sediment ripple are explained with a source-sink model that describes the pore flow velocity field. Our results suggest that bedform-induced interfacial flows are important for the uptake of particulate organic matter into permeable shelf sediments.},

L. ochroleuca showed a reduced ability to acclimatize to changing conditions, whereas S. polyschides demonstrated a larger physiological flexibility. These findings are connected with the life-history traits of these species. Additionally, optimum temperatures for the primary production of kelps were assessed, indicating higher values for inter- than subtidal S. polyschides. Significant physiological differences between inter- and subtidal S. polyschides were observed, based on metabolic rates of primary production and dark respiration. This study suggests that, under a warming climate scenario, responses can significantly vary for each species, and that L. ochroleuca is more susceptible to ocean warming than S. polyschides, due to larger acclimatization capacity of the latter. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

African rock lobster Jasus lalandii occurred during the early

(1) the predatory capabilities of J. lalandii, (2) an intricate
relationship between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and
juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, and (3) existing
over-exploitation of elements of the ecosystem, the 'lobster
invasion' has major implications for the benthic ecosystem and
associated fisheries. We surveyed the abundance of J. lalandii
and the benthic community composition EOCH at six sites (three
'invaded' and three 'non-invaded' by J. lalandii), in three
different depth zones ({\textless} 5. m, 6-12. m and 13-20. m). At all
depths, J. lalandii was significantly more abundant in invaded
areas than in non-invaded areas, and benthic communities were
significantly different. The high densities of rock lobsters at
invaded sites led to cascading effects including elimination of
urchins and depletion of grazers, consequent enhancement of
macroalgae, and diminishment of encrusting corallines.
Non-invaded sites had few lobsters, abundant herbivores, less
macroalgae and more encrusting corallines. Elimination of
urchins in the invaded area has important implications, as
juveniles of the commercially harvested abalone H. midae depend
on shelter beneath urchins in this region. Floral species
diversity was greater at invaded sites and increased with depth,
whereas faunal species diversity was greater at non-invaded
sites but also increased with depth. The depths at which
strongest effects of J. lalandii were felt coincided with the
depth of maximum abundance of the urchin P. angulosus, the
abalone H. midae, the kelp Ecklonia maxima and encrusting
corallines, with serious consequences for associated fisheries
and the benthic community. We argue that the differences between
invaded and non-invaded areas are sufficient to recognize that
they are alternate stable-states and constitute a regime shift.

were measured in 2- to 4-year-old plants of Laminaria hyperborea
from five stations with different degrees of wave exposure and
different amour:ts of canopy biomass. Low growth in plants with
initial stipe lengths of less than about 40 cm suggested that the
presence of canopy-forming plants suppresses growth of
understorey plants, and this was supported by the high lamina
growth rate of understorey plants after removal of the
canopy-forming plants. Canopy biomass and wave exposure were
found to exert a differential effect on the growth of the age
groups examined, Average annual growth per plant in 2- to
3-year-old plants decreased with increasing canopy biomass;
growth of 4 year-old plants was not significantly influenced by
canopy biomass, but increased with increasing wave exposure of
the sites, suggesting an influence of some factor connected with
wave exposure. The allocation of annual growth to stipe and
lamina was also found to be influenced by canopy biomass and wave
exposure. In 2- to 3-year-old plants the amount of annual growth
allocated to the stipe increased with increasing canopy biomass
while a positive linear regression between allocation of growth
to the stipe and wave exposure was found in 4-year-old plants.
Individual measurements carried out at a wave-exposed locality
showed that the maximum allocation of growth to the stipe in the
intermediate-sized plants occurred simultaneously with a period
of rapid stipe elongation. Thus, rapid stipe growth in L.
hyperborea can be associated with high allocation of annual
growth to the stipe when the plants are about to grow into the
canopy-forming layer. We suggest that this is due to the combined
effects of suboptimal light levels within the kelp forest and
high wave exposure.},

abstract = {Spatial dynamics of surface chlorophyll concentrations, diatom abundance and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures of surface suspended particulate matter (SPM) were investi- gated during a bloom event observed in March 2003 in the vicinity of the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands. The surface water composition was studied to estimate the overall importance and spatial extent of kelp derived SPM in the water column of the islands. It was observed that high chlorophyll concentrations (up to 2 mg m–3) between and downstream of the islands could not be explained by the development of the diatom bloom. Instead, microscopic and stable isotope analyses suggested that the chlorophyll signal was largely derived from the residual chlorophyll in fresh and decaying particles of small fragments of the kelp Macrocystis laevis, an endemic kelp species abun- dant along the shoreline of the islands. The findings of this study suggest that the dietary subsidy of kelp-derived carbon and nitrogen to benthic communities and possibly the plankton is not limited to the vicinity of kelp beds, but rather is a widespread phenomenon between the islands. Due to the dominating unidirectional Antarctic Circumpolar Current, large quantities of kelp-derived SPM may be transported and utilised tens of kilometres downstream of the islands. KEY},

Temperature and irradi- ance environment altered throughout the year, varying at 3 m between 14–20?C and 279–705 lmol pho- tons m?2 s?1. Photosynthetic capacity (Pm) varied throughout the year between 177–278 lmol O2 g?1 dry wt h?1 at 3 m and 133–348 lmol O2 g?1 dry wt h?1 at 10 m. The irradiance required for sub-saturation of photosynthesis (Ek) varied between 97–152 and 81– 142 lmol photons m?2 s?1 for 3 m and 10 m respec- tively, and the respiration rate varied between 15–36 and 13–20 lmol O2 g?1 dry wt h?1 for 3 m and 10 m. A clear seasonal change in photokinetic parameters was detected and provided strong evidence for a seasonal acclimation response. During winter an increase in the efficiency of light utilisation at low irradiance (a) was accompanied by a decrease in both Ek and that required for photosynthetic compensation. Pm also increased during the winter and autumn months and respiratory requirements decreased. These changes enable E. radiata to display an optimal photosynthetic performance throughout the year despite significant changes in the surrounding environment.},

abstract = {We examine evidence for the structuring of fish communities from stream and lake systems and the roles of biotic, abiotic, and spatial factors in determining the species composition. Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems. We identify challenges and needs that must be addressed both to advance the field of fish community ecology and to face the problems associated with human-induced changes.},

distribution of clumps of drifting algae were investigated with
5000 m2 transects at five distances from shore (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5

fish associated with drift algae were collected. Clumps of
algae, predominantly Sargassum spp., were most abundant in
spring, which coincided with the highest abundance of
alga-associated post-flexion juvenile fish. Drift algae were
also most abundant close to shore, probably due to the proximity
to source and the dominant onshore winds. Fish were quickly
attracted to drifting artificial objects (fish aggregation
device; FADs), although the magnitude of attraction varied
greatly among days. The relative abundance of small fish in open
waters available to colonise FADs and differing weather
conditions may explain much of this variability. More fish
colonised FADs with an odour source than unscented control FADs,
indicating small fish may use chemical cues to locate drifting
structures. We conclude that juvenile fish actively seek
drifting objects as pre-settlement habitat, which may reduce
predation and enhance settlement opportunities.},

abstract = {The cover of foliose algae is sparse to non-existent above a
low-level algal zone on many shores in N.S.W., except in
rock-pools. Above this algal zone, encrusting algae, mostly
Hildenbrandia prototypus, occupy most of the primary substratum
on sheltered shores. Experimental manipulations at midtidal
levels were used to test hypotheses about the effects of grazing
by molluses and of physical factors during low tide on this
pattern of algal community structure. Fences and cages were used
to exclude grazers: molluscs grazed under roofs and in open
areas. Cages and roofs provided shade, and decreased the
harshness of the environment during low tide: fences and open
areas had the normal environmental regime. In the absence of
grazers, rapid colonization of Ulva and slower colonization by
other foliose algae occurred in all experimental areas. The rate
of colonization by Ulva sporelings was initially retarded on
existing encrusting algae, but after a few months, cover of Ulva
equalled that on cleared rock. Most species of algae only grew to
maturity inside cages, and remained as a turf of sporelings
inside fences. No foliose algae grew to a visible size in open,
grazed areas. Grazing thus prevents the establishment of foliose
algae above their normal upper limit on the shore, but the
effects of physical factors during low tide prevent the growth of
algae which become established when grazers are removed. Physical
factors thus limit the abundance of foliose algae at mid-tidal
levels. The recolonization of cleared areas by Hildenbrandia was
not affected by the presence of a turf of sporelings, nor by the
shade cast by roofs, but was retarded in cages where mature algae
formed a canopy. Even under such a canopy, Hildenbrandia
eventually covered as much primary substratum as in open, grazed
areas. This encrusting alga is able to escape from the effects of
grazing by having a tough thallus, and by its vegetative growth
which allows individual plants to cover a lot of substratum, and
by the tendency for new individuals to start growing from small
cracks and pits in the rock, which are apparently inaccessible to
the grazers. Mature foliose algae are removed from the substratum
by waves, and many individual plants died during periods of hot
weather. Sporelings in a turf were eliminated, after experimental
fences were removed, by the combined effects of macroalgal
grazers, which invaded the areas, and microalgal grarers which
ate the turt from the edges inwards. The results obtained here
are discussed with respect to other studies on limits to
distribution of intertidal macroalgae, and the role of grazing in
the diversity and structure of intertidal algal communities. Some
problems of these experimental treatments are also discussed.},

abstract = {Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how
populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary
processes. Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic
uplift, and has been connected to mainland Asia several times
since its emergence. A central mountain range runs north to
south, bisecting the island, and potentially impedes gene flow
along an east-west axis. The Formosan lesser horseshoe bat
(Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where it is found
mainly at low altitude. To determine the population structure and
the demographic and colonization history of this species, we
examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203
bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and
nucleotide diversity, which decreased from the centre to the
south and north. Population differentiation followed a pattern of
isolation by distance, though most regional genetic variance was
attributable to differences between the relatively isolated
southern population and those from other regions. A haplotype
network was consistent with these findings and also suggested a
southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary contact
between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were
used to infer a past population expansion predating the last
glacial maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R.
monoceros formed a monophyletic grouping with respect to its
sister taxa. Taken together, our results suggest that this taxon
arose from a single period of colonization, and that demographic
growth followed in the late Pleistocene. Current genetic
structure reflects limited gene flow, probably coupled with
stepwise colonization in the past. We consider explanations for
the persistence of the species through multiple glacial maxima.},

intervals, elongation rates and tissue chemistry of individuals

off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, USA. The density of
the kelp canopy varied greatly during the 13 mo study, ranging
from 0.03 to 8.03 m2 blade tissue m–2 sea surface. Time series
analysis of flow velocity, light, temperature and seawater
nitrate concentrations inside and outside of the bed indicated
that when canopy density was high (May to September) current
speeds in the bed were 25{\%} of incident flow, and light below
the canopy (at 1 m depth) was reduced to 10{\%} surface
irradiance. Nitrate concentrations were highly variable and
similar between inside and outside moorings. When the canopy was
well developed, kelp fronds on the seaward edge of the bed had
faster elongation rates and larger blades, resulting in higher
overall growth rates (mass added per day) than interior fronds.
Carbon and nitrogen accumulation by edge fronds was also higher
during this period, which fueled growth rates of edge fronds
that were nearly twice as high as interior fronds when the
canopy was densest. Thus, the growth and tissue chemistry of M.
pyrifera within the kelp bed depended on the extent to which the

not so favorable results for set-up. A test run on a prototype

the model's ability to describe the shoaling, breaking, and wave

of density (numbers/100 g algae) to weight of clump and distance
from shore varied between species. The algal species composition
of clumps appeared to influence some colonizers. Only juvenile
C. lumpus were found, while all P. croni were sexually mature;
juveniles predominated in other species. The different
colonization patterns of the species can be explained partly by
their biological traits. The clumps are vital for the breeding
of P. croni and are used for feeding by C. lumpus fry. Other
species possibly colonize floating algae accidentally, being
programmed to seek attached vegetation. Floating clumps may,
nevertheless, serve to disperse these species.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence show that ocean warming off the east coast of Tasmania is the result of intensification of the East Australian Current (EAC). Increases in the strength, duration and frequency of southward incursions of warm, nutrient poor EAC water transports heat and biota to eastern Tasmania. This shift in large-scale oceanography is reflected by changes in the structure of nearshore zooplankton communities and other elements of the pelagic system; by a regional decline in the extent of dense beds of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera); by marked changes in the distribution of nearshore fishes; and by range expansions of other northern warmer-water species to colonize Tasmanian coastal waters. Population-level changes in commercially important invertebrate species may also be associated with the warming trend.Over-grazing of seaweed beds by one recently established species, the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii, is causing a fundamental shift in the structure and dynamics of Tasmanian rocky reef systems by the formation of sea urchin 'barrens' habitat. Formation of barrens represents an interaction between effects of climate change and a reduction in large predatory rock lobsters due to fishing. Barrens realize a loss of biodiversity and production from rocky reefs, and threaten valuable abalone and rock lobster fisheries and the local economies and social communities they support. This range-extending sea urchin species represents the single largest biologically mediated threat to the integrity of important shallow water rocky reef communities in eastern Tasmania.In synthesizing change in the physical ocean climate in eastern Tasmania and parallel shifts in species' distributions and ecological processes, there is evidence that the direct effects of changing physical conditions have precipitated cascading effects of ecological change in benthic (rocky reef) and pelagic systems. However, some patterns correlated with temperature have plausible alternative explanations unrelated to thermal gradients in time or space. We identify important knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to adequately understand, anticipate and adapt to future climate-driven changes in marine systems in the region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated how wave exposure and current speed interact and influence kelp Laminaria hyperborea morphology. We sampled thalli from 27 stations on the Midwest coast of Norway and recorded age, and length- and strength-related characters. We found that high wave exposure and current speed influenced holdfast biomass and stipe thickness. Wave exposure had, overall, a stronger effect than current speed. An increase in current speed seemed to have a considerable effect at low wave exposure levels, but the relationship weakened at high wave exposure levels. The length-related (‘go with the flow') characters thallus and stipe length were influenced by wave induced water flow but not by current speed. Differences in wave exposure and current speed had very weak influences on lamina biomass and length. Thus, the proportion of the thallus being lamina was high in the most sheltered areas and decreased as the wave exposure increased. Our study suggests that the strong, orbital and stochastic mode of wave exposure has a different and stronger effect as a stressor than the more regular and bidirectional stress caused by currents.},

our IBD slope with those from simulations incorporating habitat

to our knowledge is the highest reported for macroalgae. The
best regression model relating genetic distance to habitat

continuity, which were respectively, positively and negatively
related to genetic distance. Our results provide strong support

the Benguela (Atlantic Ocean) and Agulhas (Indian Ocean)
Currents. We subdivided the coastline into four `bioregions' to
test whether the regional patterning of biodiversity was
consistent with that seen more broadly. To investigate the
mechanisms responsible for the distribution and diversity of
species, we calculated the rates of change in !-diversity based
on the S{\o}rensen dissimilarity (!``{\o}{\$}) as a function of
geographical space (50-2,700 km) and Euclidian distance of
thermal dissimilarities (dE ), and determined properties such as
`serial !-diversity,' turnover (!''{\%}{\&}) and nestedness (!``'().
We employ Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) as spatial predictors
and used redundancy analysis and variation partitioning to find
the relative strengths of thermal, spatial and
spatially-structured thermal predictors. Spatial and
environmental predictors explained 91.7{\%} of the variation in the
seaweed flora, and spatially-structured environmental influences
(the thermal gradient) accounted for 58.8{\%} of this combined
pool. We found that the Benguela Current influenced west coast

high amount of !'''(, which indicates neutral assembly processes.
Along the southern and eastern coastlines, where the Agulhas

intensification of upwelling during the mid-Pliocene 4.6–3.2 Ma,
seem responsible for the strong disjunction between the
species-poor west coast and species-rich south and east coast

preferences was assessed by a combination of in situ seaweed
samplings and multiple-choice aquarium experiments in a
controlled environment, using the seaweed-associated grazing
organisms Idotea baltica and Gammarus crinicornis. Results from
the sampling data confirm that the seaweed composition
influences macrofaunal species composition and abundance:
samples dominated by Sargassum muticum displayed higher
densities but lower diversities compared to samples dominated by
Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus. Seaweed preference
was also apparent from the multiple-choice experiments, but did
not exactly match the results of the community analysis: (1) I.
baltica had high densities in seaweed samples (SWS) dominated by
F. vesiculosus and A. nodosum, while in the experiments, this
isopod was most frequently associated with Enteromorpha sp. and
F. vesiculosus, and fed mostly on S. muticum, A. nodosum and

amphipod was most frequently associated with S. muticum, but fed
most on A. nodosum and F. vesiculosus. It is clear from the
laboratory experiments that preference for habitat (shelter) and
food can differ among seaweed species. However, food and habitat
preferences are hard to assess because grazer preference may
change if choices are increased or decreased, if different sizes
of grazers are used, or if predators or other grazers are added
to the experiments. The effects of seaweed composition may also
be blurred due to the obligate opportunistic nature of a lot of
the associated macrofaunal species.},

this photosystem. The rates of electron transport (ETR)
calculated in this way were then compared with rates of
photosynthetic O{\#} evolution as measured in association with the
¯uorescence measurements. It was found that the calculated ETRs
correlated linearly with rates of ` gross ' O{\#} evolution (net
O{\#} exchange corrected for dark respiration as measured
immediately after turning off each irradiance level) within the
range of irradiances applied (up to 608 lmol photons m−{\#} s−``).
The average molar O{\#}{\}}ETR ratio was 0±238 for Ulva lactuca and
0±261 for Ulva fasciata, which is close to the theoretical
maximal value of 0±25. Rates of O{\#} evolution at various
concentrations of Ci also showed linear correlations with ETR,
and the average molar O{\#}{\}}ETR ratio was 0±249. These results
show that PAM ¯uorometry can be used as a practical tool for
quantifying photosynthetic rates at least under moderate
irradiances in thin-bladed macroalgae such as Ulva possessing a
CO{\#}-concentrating system. A comparison between the PAM- 101

abstract = {The spatial distribution of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in the NE Atlantic are highly related to physical factors and to temporal changes in temperature. On a large scale, we identified borders for kelp recovery and sea urchin persistence along the north-south gradient. Sea urchin persistence was also related to the coast-ocean gradient. The southern border corresponds to summer temperatures exceeding about 10°C, a threshold value known to be critical for sea urchin recruitment and development. The outer border along the coast-ocean gradient is related to temperature, wave exposure and salinity. On a finer scale, kelp recovery occurs mainly at ridges in outer, wave exposed, saline and warm areas whereas sea urchins still dominate in inner, shallow and cold areas, particularly in areas with optimal current speed for sea urchin foraging. In contrast to other studies in Europe, we here show a positive influence of climate change to presence of a long-lived climax canopy-forming kelp. The extent of the coast-ocean gradient varies within the study area, and is especially wide in the southern part where the presence of islands and skerries increases the area of the shallow coastal zone. This creates a large area with intermediate physical conditions for the two species and a mosaic of kelp and sea urchin dominated patches. The statistical models (GAM and BRT) show high performance and indicate recovery of kelp in 45-60{\%} of the study area. The study shows the value of combining a traditional (GAM) and a more complex (BRT) modeling approach to gain insight into complex spatial patterns of species or habitats. The results, methods and approaches are of general ecological relevance regardless of ecosystems and species, although they are particularly relevant for understanding and exploring the corresponding changes between algae and grazers in different coastal areas.},

We implemented a hierarchical sampling scheme to compare patterns of genetic diversity and structure in these two kelp species co-distributed along the coasts of Brittany (France) using a total of 12 microsatellites, nine for Laminaria hyperborea and 11 for Laminaria digitata, of which eight amplified in both species. The genetic diversity and connectivity of L. hyperborea populations were greater than those of L. digitata populations in accordance with the larger cross-shore distribution width along the coast and the greater depth occupied by L. hyperborea populations in contrast to L. digitata populations. In addition, marginal populations showed reduced genetic diversity and connectivity, which erased isolation-by-distance patterns in both species. As L. digitata encounters its southern range limit in southern Brittany (SBr) while L. hyperborea extends down to mid-Portugal, it was possible to distinguish the effect of habitat continuity from range edge effects. We found that L. digitata did not harbour high regional diversity at its southern edge, as expected in a typical rear edge, suggesting that refuges from the last glacial maximum for L. digitata were probably not located in SBr, but most likely further north. For both species, the highest levels of genetic diversity were found in the Iroise Sea and Morlaix Bay, the two regions in which they are being currently harvested. Preserving genetic diversity of these two foundation species in these areas should, thus, be a priority for the management of this resource in Brittany.},

determined by enclosing sporophylls in plastic bags for several
hours. The connection to the plant was not severed during the
experiment. Samples were withdrawn periodically by hypodermic
syringe or the sporophyll and bag were brought to the surface at
the end of the test period. Samples were preserved in formalin
and the bag was thoroughly shaken to loosen any attached spores.
Average liberation rates were about 500,000 spores/hr from
sporophylls showing well-developed sporangial areas.
Considerable variation from this average rate was found. Much
greater rates occurred if the sporophyll was plucked and
transported to the laboratory and left for a few hours in the
bag. Spore dispersal was studied by determining concentrations
of juveniles appearing around adult plants as a function of
distance from the parent. The maximum distance juveniles have
been found from isolated single transplants is 5 m. In this case
the concentration of juveniles decreased inversely as the cube
of the radius. Concentration of juveniles as a function of
distance increased as the number of adults increased. In a bed

abstract = {Kelps, brown algae of the order Laminariales, dominate rocky
shores and form huge kelp beds which provide habitat and
nurseries for various marine organisms. Whereas the basic
physiological and ecophysiological characteristics of kelps are
well studied, the molecular processes underlying acclimation to
different light and temperature conditions are still poorly
understood. Therefore we investigated the molecular mechanisms
underlying the physiological acclimation to light and temperature
stress. Sporophytes of S. latissima were exposed to combinations
of light intensities and temperatures, and microarray
hybridizations were performed to determine changes in gene
expression patterns. This first large-scale transcriptomic study
of a kelp species shows that S. latissima responds to temperature
and light stress with a multitude of transcriptional changes: up
to 32{\%} of genes showed an altered expression after the exposure
experiments. High temperature had stronger effects on gene
expression in S. latissima than low temperature, reflected by the
higher number of temperature-responsive genes. We gained insights
into underlying molecular processes of acclimation, which
includes adjustment of the primary metabolism as well as
induction of several ROS scavengers and a sophisticated
regulation of Hsps. We show that S. latissima, as a cold adapted
species, must make stronger efforts for acclimating to high than
to low temperatures. The strongest response was caused by the
combination of high temperatures with high light intensities,
which proved most harmful for the alga.},

growth of eelgrass, large brown algae and other macroalgae
measured by SCUBA-diving along 162 transects in 27 Danish fjords
and coastal waters, coupled to 1,400 data series of water
chemistry (especially nitrogen) and Secchi depth transparency
collected between March and October. Danish coastal waters are
heavily eutrophied and characterized by high particle
concentrations, turbid water and lack of macrophyte growth in
deep water. Median values are 3.6 m for Secchi depth and median
lower-depth limits are 4.0 m for eelgrass, 5.3 m for brown algae
and 5.0 m for other macroalgae. Depth limits for growth of
eelgrass and macroalgae increase linearly with transparency in
the coastal waters. The relationships are highly significant
(p{\textless}10−6) and transparency accounts for about 60{\%} of the
variability of depth limits. Eelgrass extends approximately to
half the maximum depth of macroalgae, presumably because of
greater respiratory costs to maintain the below-ground rhizomes
and roots of eelgrass, which often constitutes half the plant
weight. As a reflection of the importance of total nitrogen (TN)
in controlling phytoplankton biomass and thus Secchi depth in
coastal marine waters, we found that TN could explain 48–73{\%} of
the variation in depth limits of eelgrass and macroalgae,
according to a multiplicative model (Y=aXb). As with Secchi
depth, the relationship to eelgrass showed a lower slope,
reflecting the higher respiratory costs of eelgrass. The models
show great sensitivity and a profound quantitative response with
proportional effects on Secchi depth and depth limits when
total-N concentrations are reduced.},

The beaches sampled were primarily modally intermediate morphodynamic types, and three were groomed regularly. Species richness, abundance, and biomass of the macrofauna were high compared to values reported for similar beach types in other regions and were not predicted by morphodynamics or other physical factors. Overall species richness and abundance, and the species richness, abundance, and biomass of wrack-associated fauna and selected taxa were significantly correlated with the standing crop of macrophyte wrack. Wrack-associated macrofauna, such as amphipods, isopods, and insects, made up an average of {\textgreater}37{\%} of the species on ungroomed beaches and comprised 25{\%} or more of the total abundance on half of those beaches. The abundance of two shorebird species, plovers that forage using visual cues, was positively correlated with the standing crop of wrack and with the abundance of wrack-associated invertebrates. Significant differences in community structure, including depressed species richness, abundance, and biomass of macrofauna, especially for wrack-associated taxa, were associated with beach grooming and provided strong evidence for the bottom-up effects of wrack subsidies. Grooming also reduced the prey available to vertebrate predators, such as shorebirds. Substantial ecological effects of the large-scale disturbance and removal of organic material, food resources, and habitat are associated with beach grooming. These results suggest that macrophyte wrack subsidies strongly influence macrofaunal community structure, higher trophic levels, and ecological processes on exposed sandy beaches. The supply of macrophyte wrack should be considered as a factor in ecological studies of exposed sandy beaches, particularly where macrophyte production is high.},

populations through changes in the oceanic circulation and

assess in situ, a first step in studying the effects of climate
change can be achieved using biophysical models. To date, only a
few biophysical models have been used for this purpose. Here we
review these studies and also include results from other recent
modelling efforts. We show that increased sea temperature, a
major change expected under climate warming, may impact
dispersal and connectivity patterns via changes in reproductive
phenology (e.g., shift in the spawning season), transport (e.g.,
reduced pelagic larval duration under faster development rates),
mortality (e.g., changes in the exposure to lethal
temperatures), and behaviour (e.g., increased larval swimming
speed). Projected changes in circulation are also shown to have
large effects on the simulated dispersal and connectivity
patterns. Although these biophysical modelling studies are
useful preliminary approaches to project the potential effects
of climate change, we highlight their current limitations and
discuss the way forward, in particular the need for adequate
coupled hydrodynamic–biogeochemical simulations using
atmospheric forcing from realistic climate change scenarios.},

several years consecutively in the Yellow Sea since 2007. In
view of the rapid growth of green macroalgae, early detection of
its patches at first appearance by satellite imagery is of
importance, and the central issue is the selection of
appropriate satellite data. As a first step towards this goal,
based on quasi-synchronous satellite images of HJ-1A/B (China
Small Satellite Constellation for Environment and Disaster
Monitoring and Forecasting) charge-coupled devices (CCDs),
Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) Advanced Synthetic Aperture
Radar (ASAR) and TERRA Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS), GMB monitoring abilities by these
data were compared. The average percentage difference (APD) of
the GMB areas derived by ASAR and CCD was less than 15{\%}, which
may be partly attributed to the inability of synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) data to detect macroalgae suspended beneath the sea
surface. The macroalgae area extracted by MODIS was over two
times of that extracted by CCD, which was mainly explained by
the difference in their spatial resolutions (250 vs 30 m). The
effects of the configuration of sensor bands and the aerosol
optical properties on the comparison result were found to be
negligible, and the underlying reason is analysed by atmosphere
radiative transfer modelling. With satellite images, the
drifting velocity of macroalgae patches was estimated to be
about 0.21 m s?1, which was in agreement with the surface
current field numerically simulated by the Hybrid Coordinate
Ocean Model (HYCOM). It indicates that numerical modelling can
aid in deduction of the situation of the patches when satellite
data are not available, and on the other hand, satellite data
can be used to estimate sea-surface currents through monitoring
the movement of green algae. By a comprehensive comparison of
available satellite data in operation, for the early detection
of macroalgae patches and warning of a massive bloom, CCD data
from the HJ-1A/B constellation was preferred, with 30 m spatial
resolution, 700 km swath width and 2 day revisiting period. SAR
data may be an effective supplement, which can avoid the effects
of bad weather (cloud, fog and haze) on optical satellite
monitoring.},

Other species are still present, but fisheries have had huge
effects on the abundances, size–frequencies, and/or spatial
distributions of sheephead, kelp bass, rays, flatfish, rock fish,
spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even sea cucumbers,
crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated fishing. The

loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the
megafauna have been removed with very little documentation or
historical understanding of what the natural community was like.
Thus, our ability to separate anthropogenic impacts from the

Previous quantitative analysis revealed major discrepancies between official data (which essentially underreports artisanal and ignores subsistence fisheries catches) and re-estimated data obtained from various reports. This resulted in a doubling of the landed value of small-scale fisheries catches to 3.5 billion USD year-1 compared to officially reported numbers. Similarly, employment estimated officially at 1 million fishers was found here to be only 70{\%} higher when subsistence fisheries are included. For the 22 West African countries considered in this study, we estimate that 6.7 million people directly depend on fishing activities for their food and/or livelihood. Furthermore, the present study shows an increasing reliance of West Africa's coastal population on fisheries for their food and income despite decreasing total income and increasing fishing costs, which in turn aggravated poverty. The notion that small-scale fisheries could contribute to poverty alleviation despite crises and shocks is thus highly contestable. Indeed, although the number of people depending on fisheries is still increasing, driven by their current (even though decreasing) profitability, the perception of small-scale fishing as an activity of last resort is probably justified, and more appropriate than viewing it as a source of sustainable livelihood.},

organisms, but their survival at the sea surface may be
compromised by physiological stress and epibiont overgrowth.
Most previous experiments have been conducted in laboratory
mesocosms where epibiont colonization is limited, but in their
natural environment floating seaweeds are frequently overgrown
by epibionts, which might negatively affect seaweeds or even
cause their sinking. To test this hypothesis, we conducted field
experiments in northern-central Chile
(30{\{}$\backslash$textbackslashtextdegree{\}}S) with floating giant kelps
Macrocystis pyrifera to determine the time until sinking,
epibiotic bryozoan load, and their physiological status across
different seasons. Floating sporophytes persisted for at least 4
weeks at the sea surface and sank in all seasons after bryozoan
loads exceeded 40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the raft biomass. At the time of
sinking, the kelp rafts were physiologically viable and biomass
losses were relatively minor. In autumn, kelp rafts stayed
afloat for an average of 41 days (maximum: 52 days) during
moderate environmental conditions (cool water temperature and
moderate solar radiation) and slow growth of epibionts. However,
higher water temperatures in summer seemed to enhance the growth
of epibiotic bryozoans but not the growth of M. pyrifera,
causing earlier sinking. The results indicate that the high
growth rates of encrusting bryozoans provoke sinking of the kelp
rafts, representing the first demonstrated case of
epibiont-induced sinking of otherwise healthy floating seaweeds.
Increasing global temperatures may enhance epibiont growth and
thereby suppress the dispersal potential of floating seaweeds,
even of species known for their high acclimation potential to
the conditions at the sea surface.},

abstract = {Abstract Summer near-surface temperatures over the northeast
coast of the Antarctic Peninsula have increased by more than 2°C
over the past 40 years, a temperature increase 3 times greater
than that on the northwest coast. Recent analysis has shown a
strong correlation between this striking warming trend and
significant change in the summer Southern Hemisphere annular
mode (SAM), which has resulted in greatly increased summer
westerlies across the northern peninsula. It has been proposed
that the strengthening westerlies have resulted in increased
vertical deflection of relatively warm maritime air over the
northern peninsula, contributing significantly to the observed
warming and the recent collapse of northern sections of the
Larsen Ice Shelf. In this study, laboratory and numerical
modeling of airflow incident to the peninsula are employed to
further understand this mechanism. It is shown that the effect
of the strengthening westerlies has led to a distinct transition
from a ?blocked? regime to a ?flow-over? regime, that is,
confirmation of the proposed warming mechanism. The blocked
regime is dominated by flow stagnation upstream (i.e., little
vertical deflection) and consequent lateral deflection of flow
along the western side of the peninsula. The flow-over regime is
dominated by vertical deflection of mid/upper-level air over the
peninsula, with strong downslope winds following closely to the
leeward slope transporting this air (which warms adiabatically
as it descends) to the near-surface of the northeast peninsula.
The strong rotation typical of high latitudes considerably
increases the flow over the peninsula, particularly
strengthening it over the southern side (verified by aircraft
measurements), suggesting that the warming trend is not solely
confined to the northeast. Globally, flow regime transitions
such as this may be responsible for other local climate
variations.},

The epiphytic algae associated with the stipe of Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie are important as habitat and food source for numerous faunal species along the Norwegian coastline. My investigations were performed on samples taken from kelp stipes in the area of Finn{\o}y, mid-Norway, in April, June, September and November 2005. I address questions of how the epiphytic community structure and primary production relates to a gradient of wave exposure, and the seasonal aspects of these relationships were also brought into the analyses. Both univariate and multivariate statistical methods were used in this approach. The amount of biomass found on a stipe was first of all related to the length of the stipe, and stipe lengths increased with increasing levels of wave exposure. A definite peak in total biomass was found in September. The species composition of epiphytes on the kelp stipes showed variation with increasing exposure. However, the variation within sites with the same index of exposure was also very high, suggesting that differences on a smaller scale may be of great importance. Differences in the species composition between sampling periods were also found. I conclude that both epiphyte species composition and productivity in kelp forest areas are affected by wave exposure, or some factors related to wave exposure, and that the structures of these epiphytic communities change through the season},

consistent effects. The current study adopted a multi-step
approach (ANOVA followed by multiple regression and permutation)
to assess the cumulative effects of multiple QTLs. Using a
system-level (dopamine system) genetic approach, we investigated
a personality trait deeply rooted in the nervous system (the
Highly Sensitive Personality, HSP). 480 healthy Chinese college
students were given the HSP scale and genotyped for 98
representative polymorphisms in all major dopamine
neurotransmitter genes. In addition, two environment factors
(stressful life events and parental warmth) that have been
implicated for their contributions to personality development
were included to investigate their relative contributions as
compared to genetic factors. In Step 1, using ANOVA, we
identified 10 polymorphisms that made statistically significant
contributions to HSP. In Step 2, these polymorphism's main
effects and interactions were assessed using multiple
regression. This model accounted for 15{\%} of the variance of HSP
(p{\textless}0.001). Recent stressful life events accounted for an
additional 2{\%} of the variance. Finally, permutation analyses
ascertained the probability of obtaining these findings by
chance to be very low, p ranging from 0.001 to 0.006. Dividing
these loci by the subsystems of dopamine synthesis,
degradation/transport, receptor and modulation, we found that
the modulation and receptor subsystems made the most significant
contribution to HSP. The results of this study demonstrate the
utility of a multi-step neuronal system-level approach in
assessing genetic contributions to individual differences in
human behavior. It can potentially bridge the gap between the
high heritability estimates based on traditional behavioral
genetics and the lack of reproducible genetic effects observed
currently from molecular genetic studies.},

Empirical evidence of historical changes in species inter-actions within climate-impacted communities is, however, rare and difficult to obtain. Here, we demonstrate the recent disappearance of key habitat-forming kelp forests from a warming tropical–tem-perate transition zone in eastern Australia. Using a 10-y video data-set encompassing a 0.6 °C warming period, we show how herbivory increased as kelp gradually declined and then disappeared. Concur-rently, fish communities from sites where kelp was originally abun-dant but subsequently disappeared became increasingly dominated by tropical herbivores. Feeding assays identified two key tropical/ subtropical herbivores that consumed transplanted kelp within hours at these sites. There was also a distinct increase in the abun-dance of fishes that consume epilithic algae, and much higher bite rates by this group at sites without kelp, suggesting a key role for these fishes in maintaining reefs in kelp-free states by removing kelp recruits. Changes in kelp abundance showed no direct relation-ship to seawater temperatures over the decade and were also un-related to other measured abiotic factors (nutrients and storms).

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Kelps are highly productive seaweeds predominantly found in wave-exposed environments. Physical and biological processes such as sand abrasion, whiplash and grazing can wound kelp tissue, potentially weakening its ability to withstand wave forces. Despite the ecological importance of kelp tissue loss, few studies have quantified wounding patterns in kelps or how wounding might affect the biomechanical properties of kelps. We quantified the prevalence of wounds on 360 Ecklonia radiata kelps collected across 3 different reef lines (levels of wave exposure) in April (autumn), June (early winter), August (winter) and October (early spring) (i.e. before, during and after peak wave activity). Small holes in the centre of laterals dominated the wounds. Wounding pattern did not differ between reef lines but changed over time, with most in early winter and least in early spring (from 285 to 71 wounds kelp−1). This pattern suggests that wounds accumulate over summer and that highly wounded parts of the frond (but not the entire kelp) break off when encountering the first storms. Biomechanical break-force tests assessed the effect of experimental wounds on the forces required to break kelp tissue. These tests showed that holes or horizontal cuts to the edge of the kelp frond dramatically reduced the strength, extensibility, toughness and stiffness of the tissue. We conclude that wounds are common in E. radiata and that the resulting loss of tissue integrity, caused by even small damages, can dramatically increase the susceptibility to breakage. Our findings may have important ecological implications; the peak in wounds in early winter is likely to increase fragmentation of the kelp, thereby reducing its size and hydrodynamic drag, and, paradoxically, reducing the risk of fatal dislodgment during severe winter storms.},

We measured the morphology and attachment strength of Codium over

(circumference-to-length ratio) of Codium varied inversely with
the degree of wave exposure and water motion. Attachment strength

generally did not differ between sites and seasons. We examined
the effect of morphology on survival of Codium by experimentally
trimming the thallus (by cutting 33 or 66{\%} of branches) in a
field experiment over 1 year. Trimming, which simulated natural
fragmentation, had a positive effect on survival relative to
untrimmed controls, particularly at the most wave-exposed site
and after a major storm event (Hurricane Juan), and the magnitude
of this effect was related to the degree of trimming. We used a
flume tank to measure drag forces at different flow velocities

levels of trimming as in the field experiment). Drag was
positively related to plant circumference and water velocity, and
negatively related to the degree of trimming. Attachment strength
of these plants was 10 to 22 times greater than the drag force,
suggesting that Codium is dislodged when flow velocities greatly

decreased with circumference, indicating a greater risk of

1986; $\backslash$textbackslash'O Foighil, 1989; $\backslash$textbackslash'O Foighil
et al., 1999).A number of physical oceanographic processes tend
to aggregate flotsam. Fronts and eddies tend to collect
biological and non-biological material through processes such as
Langmuir circulation, small-scale frontal systems, internal
waves and tidal fronts (Pingree, 1974; Shanks, 1983; Kingsford
and Choat, 1986; Franks, 1992). A wide diversity of organisms
aggregate around these processes: seabirds, marine mammals,
marine turtles, sea snakes, a variety of fishes, and many
invertebrates (Hunter and Mitchell, 1967; Hunter and Mitchell,
1968; Barstow, 1982; Fedoryako, 1982; Shanks, 1983; Kingsford
and Choat, 1986; Le Fevre, 1986; Haney, 1987; Silber, 1990; Au,
1991; Kingsford et al., 1991; Pitman, 1993; Arenas et al.,
1999). While detached macroalgae (Highsmith, 1985; Helmuth et
al., 1994), pumice (Jokiel, 1984; Jokiel, 1989), and eelgrass
(Worcester, 1994) have received some attention as means of
dispersal mechanisms, woody flotsam has been relatively ignored
as habitat or as a dispersal agent for marine
invertebrates.Here, we document invertebrate organisms rafting
on woody flotsam in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and provide a
simple measure of rafting frequency for the species observed. We
also test the importance of flotsam surface area and distance
from shore in determining species richness of the invertebrate
flotsam community, and report the frequency of different flotsam
types in Bay of Panama. We propose a simple scheme for
classifying organisms associated with floating debris, and
discuss the natural history of select rafting invertebrates with
an emphasis on how certain life history traits may be
advantageous to dispersal by rafting. These observations provide
a preliminary indication of the invertebrate species associated
with floating woody debris in this nearshore geographic region,
and the importance of this resource to some of these organisms.},

abstract = {The strength of interactions between predators and their prey (interaction strength) varies enormously among species within ecological communities. Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions may be more stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported log-normal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator-prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments were used to determine maximum per capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum per capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum per capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities.},

The "top-down" school holds that predators limit herbivores and thereby prevent them from overexploiting vegetation. "Bottom-up" proponents stress the role of plant chemical defenses in limiting plant depredation by herbivores. A set of predator-free islands created by a hydroelectric impoundment in Venezuela allows a test of these competing world views. Limited area restricts the fauna of small (0.25 to 0.9 hectare) islands to predators of invertebrates (birds, lizards, anurans, and spiders), seed predators (rodents), and herbivores (howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants). Predators of vertebrates are absent, and densities of rodents, howler monkeys, iguanas, and leaf-cutter ants are 10 to 100 times greater than on the nearby mainland, suggesting that predators normally limit their populations. The densities of seedlings and saplings of canopy trees are severely reduced on herbivore-affected islands, providing evidence of a trophic cascade unleashed in the absence of top-down regulation.},

The species has been impacted by sealing operations since the 1600s, and historical records suggest that the taxon experienced a bottleneck prior to the 20th century. Mitochondrial DNA control region sequences were generated for 106 individuals belonging to six breeding colonies. Haplotype diversity was found to be high (0.975 +/- 0.014) whereas levels of nucleotide diversity were much lower compared to other seal species (0.011 +/- 0.006). An analysis of molecular variance indicated that the largest percentage of haplotype diversity is distributed within colonies rather than among them. This could be attributed to either extensive gene flow among colonies, a lack of substantial female site philopatry, or incomplete lineage sorting of haplotypes. Mismatch distribution and Fu's F (S) test indicated that the population has experienced a historical population expansion probably between c. 37,000-18,000 YBP and this date coincides very well with the height of the last glacial maximum when food resources were abundant in the South Atlantic. These results also suggest that the recent sealing-induced bottleneck did not have a profound influence on the haplotype diversity and a historical bottleneck prior to a demographic expansion may have been severe enough to reduce nucleotide diversity substantially.},

abstract = {Vertical structure of tidal current in a typically coastal
raft-culture area is discussed by a numerical model. A
one-dimensional hydrodynamic model was modified to include the
tidal surface boundary layer for describing the interaction
between aquaculture and tidal flow and parameterized with the
field data. It replicated the observed velocity profile and was
then used to investigate the impacts of varying culture
densities and bottom frictions on the vertical tidal current
structure. Modeling results indicate that the surface current
velocity was largely damped because culture activities enhanced
the frictional effects on flow intensively. The magnitude and
vertical structure of tidal current are determined by
aquaculture drag and bottom friction. The magnitude damps so
rapidly that the vertical double-log profile is distorted within
a water column when the frictional effect of culture density
increases to a certain threshold value. The vertical structure
is remarkably deformed by the varying magnitude of bottom
friction. In addition,the vertical velocity structure has a
nonlinear trend along with culture density and bottom friction.
The variation of the vertical structure is a kind of
adaptation/adjustment to both surface friction (aquaculture
drag) and bottom shear stress under the tidal forcing. This
study is a theoretical foundation for optimizing aquaculture
configuration through regulating culture density and species
distribution. The frictional effect of culture-organisms-growth
and suspended cage on the flow should be considered in further
studies.},

abstract = {Abstract In South Africa, more than 7000 t (f wt) of kelp (Ecklonia maxima) fronds are harvested annually to feed cultured abalone. Carpoblepharis flaccida, Gelidium vittatum and Polysiphonia virgata are conspicuous red algal epiphytes on older kelps and provide habitat and food for numerous animals. Over 4.5 y, we examined the effects of one destructive harvest of E. maxima on these 3 epiphytes. Two 20 20 m plots of kelp with similar epiphyte loads were demarcated. In one, all E. maxima sporophytes with stipes longer than 50 cm were harvested. The other plot served as a control. After 2.5 y the biomass of E. maxima in the harvested plot had recovered to control levels, but the epiphyte load (g epiphytes. Kg kelp1) was statistically lower in the harvested plot after 2.5 and 3.5 y, and only recovered after 4.5 y. While most commercial harvesters cut through the ``heads'' (primary blades) of the kelp, effectively killing them, a new, non-lethal method removes secondary blades 20-30 cm from their bases, leaving the meristems and primary blades intact. At 5 sites studied, G. vittatum and P. virgata were found almost entirely on stipes and primary blades, and harvesting only distal parts of secondary blades limited losses to about 50{\%} of C. flaccida biomass. To protect epiphytes, non-lethal harvesting is recommended and permanent non-harvest zones have been established in addition to limiting kelp yields and disallowing harvesting in Marine Protected Areas.},

We evaluate differences within and between kelps and fucoids in life histories as they affect population biology; dispersal and poten- tial limitations in population establishment; macroscopic stages and variations in survival and longevity affecting stand structure; and mi- croscopic stage responses to disturbance and variation in the physical environment. We suggest that the commonly made comparisons of seaweeds with terrestrial seed plants are misleading because of large differences in morphology, environments, and the ephemeral na- ture of propagule banks in the sea.

distinct phases. The macrofauna, including the talitrid amphipod

Coleoptera, colonised the kelp within 1 day, with highest numbers
recorded after 3 days. Following this, their presence in the
samples declined and the meiofauna, which consisted of nematodes,
enchytraeids, dipteran larvae, and mites, became increasingly
abundant. After 18 days in the field, the meiofauna dominated the
kelp surface. This faunal succession did not relate directly to
the degradation of the algal tissues, which proceeded linearly
for the entire study period. Algal material was lost from the

abstract = {The kelp-bed fish fauna off Santa Barbara is mainly
warm-temperate, but includes abun- dances of some primarily
cool-temperate species from the north. Using underwater movie
strips (cinetransects), we sampled assemblages of this fauna,
near the kelp canopy and just over the reef bottom, in nine
localities along Santa Cruz Island and the adjacent mainland
coast. Factor analysis of these samples indicated that the
species are loosely organized into five ``habitat groups,'' which
are characteristic of (1) areas of high-relief rock and dense
kelp, (2) the kelp canopy. (3) shallow areas at or beyond the
margins of reefs and kelp beds, (4) the midwaters, from kelp
canopy to bottom, and (5) areas of reef bottom and sparse kelp.
Mean fish density, biomass, and diversity varied significantly
among localities and between mainland and island, but not between
winter-spring and summer-fall. Means increased with rocky relief
and bottom depth, and were generally greatest for island
localities. Relatively more habitat generalists from the marginal
and midwater groups (e.g. surfperches) occurred in areas of mixed
bottom types and turbid water. More reef specialists from the
kelp-rock group, many of which require shelter holes at night,
occurred in areas of extensive rocky bottom and clear water.
Phylogenetically, these sheltering species have comparatively
close tropical relatives (i.e. are ``tropical derivatives''). The
island assemblages contained greater abundances of tropical
derivatives, which contributed to the higher fish density and
diversity. This ``island effect ' on species composition is
probably caused by habitat differences rather than oceano-
graphic differences or isolation between mainland and island.
Island habitats, as well as island-like habitats along the
mainland, have clearer water, more continuous high-relief rocky
bottom, and perhaps more fish food. Thus, they may offer more
opportunities for tropical derivatives to shelter at night and to
partition the available space and food during the day},

abstract = {Species distributions have shifted in response to global warming in all major ecosystems on the Earth. Despite cogent evidence for these changes, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and currently imply gradual shifts. Yet there is an increasing appreciation of the role of discrete events in driving ecological change. We show how a marine heat wave (HW) eliminated a prominent habitat-forming seaweed, Scytothalia dorycarpa, at its warm distribution limit, causing a range contraction of approximately 100 km (approx. 5{\%} of its global distribution). Seawater temperatures during the HW exceeded the seaweed's physiological threshold and caused extirpation of marginal populations, which are unlikely to recover owing to life-history traits and oceanographic processes. Scytothalia dorycarpa is an important canopy-forming seaweed in temperate Australia, and loss of the species at its range edge has caused structural changes at the community level and is likely to have ecosystem-level implications. We show that extreme warming events, which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, can force step-wise changes in species distributions in marine ecosystems. As such, return times of these events have major implications for projections of species distributions and ecosystem structure, which have typically been based on gradual warming trends.},

exerted on that resource. The aim of sustainable management is
to have resources that are in an optimal state and that are
fished at optimal levels. However, historical over-fishing may
have reduced some stocks to depleted or heavily depleted levels,
and rebuilding these stocks could be attempted by reducing
fishing pressure. Such re- building can take several years or
even decades as the rate of recovery is dependent both on the
biology of the species concerned and on natural recruitment
fluctuations. Additionally, short-lived species (e.g. anchovy
and squid) typically show high levels of recruitment variability
that can result in substantial inter-annual fluctuations in
population size; these could lead to the status of that resource
changing from being depleted in one year to being optimal in the
next. Five categories are defined for stock status, ranging from
`Abundant' though to `Heavily depleted', and including an
`Unknown' category for which there are insufficient or con-
flicting data to enable an accurate estimate to be made. Four
categories of fishing pressure are defined, from `Light' though`
Optimal' to `Heavy', and again including an `Unknown' category
for data-poor resources. The},

abstract = {Management and conservation can be greatly informed by considering explicitly how environmental factors influence population genetic structure. Using simulated larval dispersal estimates based on ocean current observations, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of frequency of exchange of larvae among sites via ocean advection can fundamentally change the interpretation of empirical population genetic structuring as compared with conventional spatial genetic analyses. Both frequency of larval exchange and empirical genetic difference were uncorrelated with Euclidean distance between sites. When transformed into relative oceanographic distances and integrated into a genetic isolation-by-distance framework, however, the frequency of larval exchange explained nearly 50 per cent of the variance in empirical genetic differences among sites over scales of tens of kilometres. Explanatory power was strongest when we considered effects of multiple generations of larval dispersal via intermediary locations on the long-term probability of exchange between sites. Our results uncover meaningful spatial patterning to population genetic structuring that corresponds with ocean circulation. This study advances our ability to interpret population structure from complex genetic data characteristic of high gene flow species, validates recent advances in oceanographic approaches for assessing larval dispersal and represents a novel approach to characterize population connectivity at small spatial scales germane to conservation and fisheries management.},

abstract = {In this study we explored the trophic relationships between intertidal and subtidal ecosystems of a rocky-shore community. We selected the most abundant intertidal primary consumers, principally invertebrate grazers and filter-feeders, and investigated their trophic connections with in situ intertidal production (internal) and/or subtidal kelp production (external). Using two stable isotopes (nitrogen and carbon), we examined the degree to which filter feeders depend trophically on kelp detritus or pelagic phytoplankton, and to which intertidal grazers depend on subtidal kelps or intertidal micro- and macroalgae. The filter-feeders used kelp-derived detritus as their main source of organic carbon and nitrogen. Similarly, two abundant and highly specialized grazers also used subtidal kelps as their main source of carbon and nitrogen, although other more generalized intertidal grazers relied mainly on the in situ epilithic algal production. We determined the extent to which kelp detritus contributes to the total particulate organic matter (POM) on exposed and sheltered habitats during different tidal phases. Kelp-derived detritus represented more than 65{\%} of POM, being consistently high all year round and during both high and low tides, but was particularly high on exposed shores. Phytoplankton was seldom found and contributed no more than 6{\%} of total intertidal POM. We conclude that kelp-derived detritus represents a steady source of food for filter- feeders, upon which they can rely all year round. A short-term experiment revealed that the water turnover on exposed shores was about seven times greater than on sheltered shores; the consequent increase in the supply of food may explain why filter-feeder biomass is high on wave exposed shores. Finally, a simple steady-state model was built to simulate mussel standing stock (biomass per unit area) as a function of food supply and water turnover. The model predicts significantly lower mussel standing stock on sheltered than exposed shores. We conclude that replenishment of food by wave action is sufficient to explain the observed differences of filter feeder biomass between exposed and sheltered shores. It is also concluded that subtidal macrophyte production greatly influences the structure of intertidal rocky-shore communities on the west coast of South Africa.},

abstract = {Abstract Polar seaweeds are strongly adapted to the low
temperatures of their environment, Antarctic species more
strongly than Arctic species due to the longer cold water history
of the Antarctic region. By reason of the strong isolation of the
Southern Ocean the Antarctic marine flora is characterized by a
high degree of endemism, whereas in the Arctic only few endemic
species have been found so far. All polar species are strongly
shade adapted and their phenology is finely tuned to the strong
seasonal changes of the light conditions. The paper summarises
the present knowledge of seaweeds from both polar regions with
regard to the following topics: the history of seaweed research
in polar regions; the environment of seaweeds in polar waters;
biodiversity, biogeographical relationships and vertical
distribution of Arctic and Antarctic seaweeds; life histories and
physiological thallus anatomy; temperature demands and
geographical distribution; light demands and depth zonation; the
effect of salinity, temperature and desiccation on supra-and
eulittoral seaweeds; seasonality of reproduction and the
physiological characteristics of microscopic developmental
stages; seasonal growth and photosynthesis; elemental and
nutritional contents and chemical and physical defences against
herbivory. We present evidence to show that specific
characteristics and adaptations in polar seaweeds help to explain
their ecological success under environmentally extreme
conditions. In conclusion, as a perspective and guide for future
research we draw attention to many remaining gaps in knowledge.},

abstract = {The morphology of Potamogeton pectinatus L. varies markedly between two sites, with different degrees of wave exposure, in the northern Baltic proper. To study the morphological variation attributable to phenotypic plasticity, tubers and sediment were reciprocally transplanted between the two sites. Several plant characters respond plastically to sediment type. The average values in muddy compared with sandy sediment was: for plant dry weight 1.0 g and 0.4 g; for total rhizome length 1.3 m and 0.6 m; for root:shoot ratio 0.08 and 0.21 respectively. Plants collected at the sheltered site were significantly more phenotypically plastic in total growth and rhizome length, than plants originating from the exposed site. The size of the transplanted tubers had a significant impact on growth and survival of the plants. Shoot length and branching were greatly affected by the above-sediment conditions, i.e. mainly wave exposure. The shoots were on average 21 cm tall at the sheltered site and only 10 cm at the wave exposed site. This was mainly due to a plastic response in internode length and to a minor extent to dislodgement of shoot parts. Many of the observed plastic responses in morphology of P. pectinatus result from phenotypic plasticity in growth. The plasticity in the root:shoot ratio to the nutrient content of the sediment and the plasticity in growth pattern to the degree of wave exposure are however suitable adjustments in resource allocation to the environmental conditions. All measured characters showed significant phenotypic plasticity in the experiment, nevertheless large morphological differences remained between plants from the two sites, when grown under the same environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The effect of human trampling on the abundance of small invertebrates inhabiting rocky shallow bottoms was studied at Asinara Island MPA. To this aim we have conducted two experiments. The first was a quantitative study and tested the hypothesis that small invertebrates are more abundant at no-entry locations than at the location visited by tourists through time (before, during and after tourist season). The second was a manipulative experiment and tested the hypothesis that the abundance of small invertebrates is indirectly related to experimental trampling intensities. The effect due to tourist visitation was not highlighted on overall assemblages, suggesting that present seasonal tourist load at the MPA does not cause a significantly negative effect on the zoobenthic community studied. Although tourists exhibited trampling activity at the visited location, none of taxa examined showed a significant lower abundance during and strictly after the end of seasonal tourism peak in the visited location, rather than at control locations. However, results obtained with the second experiment suggested that the effects of different experimental trampling intensities on small invertebrates were variable among taxa. The experimental trampling caused immediate declines in the density of tanaids, nematodes, acari, bivalves, gammarids, echinoderms, isopods, and harpacticoids. For some of these taxa a recovery in abundance was observed within one month. This kind of data may offer important information to estimate the number of visitors compatible with the sensitivity of zoobenthic assemblages, and may substantially contribute to appropriate MPA management. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

2010. It had serious impacts on humans and natural ecosystems,
it was the strongest recorded globally in recent decades and
exceeded in amplitude and spatial extent the previous hottest
European summer in 2003. Earlier studies have not succeeded in
comparing the magnitude of heat waves across continents and in
time. This study introduces a new Heat Wave Magnitude Index that
can be compared over space and time. The index is based on the
analysis of daily maximum temperature in order to classify the
strongest heat waves that occurred worldwide during the three
study periods 1980?1990, 1991?2001, and 2002?2012. In addition,
multimodel ensemble outputs from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 are used to project future
occurrence and severity of heat waves, under different
Representative Concentration Pathways, adopted by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for its Fifth
Assessment Report (AR5). Results show that the percentage of
global area affected by heat waves has increased in recent
decades. Moreover, model predictions reveal an increase in the
probability of occurrence of extreme and very extreme heat waves
in the coming years, in particular, by the end of this century,
under the most severe IPCC AR5 scenario, events of the same
severity as that in Russia in the summer of 2010 will become the

alternative to ``traditional'' methods, such as direct sampling,

parameters to produce rules to understand species distribution

most significant key parameters to predict KF frequency are (1)
the nature of the substrate, (2) depth, (3) water transparency,

with the flexibility of algae in a flow. All these parameters
are integrated in a spatial model, built using a Geographical
Information System. This model results in a KF frequency map,
where sites with optimum key parameters show a deeper limit of
disappearance. After validation, the model is used in the
context of Climate Change to estimate the effect of
environmental variation on this depth limit of KF. Thus, the
effects of both an increase in water temperature and a decrease
in its transparency could lead to the complete disappearance of

abstract = {The ability of algae to change the shape of their thallus in response to the environment may be of functional and ecological importance to the alga, with many species of macroalgae exhibiting a great range of morphological variation across wave exposure gradients. However, differences in morphology detected between sheltered and exposed environments cannot determine whether such differences represent plastic responses to the local environment or whether morphology is genetically fixed. This study tested for differences in the morphology of the common kelp, Ecklonia radiata, between wave sheltered and exposed environments, and reciprocally transplanted juveniles to distinguish the nature of such differences (i.e. plastic vs fixed traits). Differences between exposure environments were consistent with known effects of exposure (i.e. a wide, thin thallus at sheltered sites and a narrow, thick thallus with a thick stipe at exposed sites). The reciprocal transplant experiment confirmed that morphological plasticity was the mechanism enabling this alga to display different patterns in morphology between exposure environments. Individuals transplanted to the exposed environment underwent a rapid and extreme response in morphology, which was not apparent in individuals transplanted to the sheltered environment that responded more slowly. These results suggest that stressors typical of sheltered environments (i.e. diffusion stress) may not be as influential (if at all) compared to stressors typical of exposed environments (i.e. breakage, dislodgement) in differentiating morphological characters between exposure environments.},
annote = {{\textgreater} Morphological variation enables species to occupy a broad range of physical environments and is commonly thought to enhance the survival and productivity of plants growing in physically different environments. 

{\textgreater} Kelp morphology in relation to environmental gradients have been well documented.

{\textgreater} At sheltered sites macroalgal fronds tend to be wide, thin and undulate and at exposed sites are narrow, thick, flat and thick stipes. These morphological differences are thought to enable macroalgae to inhabit wave sheltered environments without compromising photosynthetic ability and growth and wave exposed environments by reducing breakage and/or dislodgement.

{\textgreater} Due to the range in scale of studies performed on this subject, no evidence has been presented whether the these responses to environmental gradients are plastic or fixed genetic responses based on ecotype which that particular population is adapted for. 

{\textgreater} This study used a combination of observational and experimental analyses revealed that different mprhologies existed between exposed and sheltered sites.

{\textgreater} The differences in morphology is considered a plastic response to the local enviornment and did not reflect gentically fixed traits.

{\textgreater}The morphological responses exbited in this study was consistent with physiological and mechanical responses reported in other studies

{\textgreater} 11 out of 14 kelp morphology characters responded consistently to the differences in exposure. However 3 characters responded in an incosistent way (plant length, stipe length and lamina length). 

{\textgreater} The results from the transplant experiment indicate a phenotypic response to the local environment. i.e transplanted individuals did not retain characters from their naitive site. Furthermore, transplanted individuals exbited characters consistent with naturally occuring individuals. 

{\textgreater} Interestingly, individuals transplanted to wave exposed sites responded more rapidly compared to individuals transplanted to wave-sheltered sites. Furthermore, in wave exposed sites responses were sometimes over compensated for and maifested in the form of longer stipe lengths. 

{\textgreater} In conclusion, variation in morphology of E. radiata exists across southern Australia which we now understand, at the scales of km,can be driven by the xternal environment. This study suggests that the environmentally specific forms of E. radiata in wave exposed and wave sheltered environments, at scales of 1-10km, are the result of a plastic response to the exposure conditions typical of the kelp native environment. Results also suggest that stressors typical of sheltered environments (i.e diffusion stress) may not be as influential compared to stressors typical of exposed environments (i.e. breakage/dislodgment) in differentiating morphological characters between exposure environments.},

In total, 552 individual settlers were mapped and followed daily during their first 3 to 5 d after settlement in May 1992 and were then periodically re-examined over a 45 d period. A sharp decline in survivorship occurred during the first day after settlement. For settlers arriving on 16 and 17 May, mortality during the first day after settlement (38.0{\%}) was almost as high as all mortality during the following 44 d (40.1{\%}). Mortality during the first day after settlement was 1.5 to 6.0 times higher than during the second day for settlers arriving on 16, 17 and 18 May. There was no relationship, however, between percent first day mortality and densities of recruits or of grazers (limpets, littorines). The elevated levels of first day mortality were also not consistent with desiccation stress, wave exposure, or size-specific changes in vulnerability. The first moments after settlement may constitute a bottleneck for the survival of barnacles settling in the intertidal zone. For organisms such as B.glandula, selective pressures for traits such as time of settlement relative to the tidal cycle, selection of settlement micro-site, and energy reserves at settlement could be most intense during the first day in the benthic habitat.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a model for determining the size
and shape of a steady-state latent heat coastal polynya in terms
of the following free parameters: 1) the frazil ice production
rate (F); 2) the wind stress ($\tau$); 3) the surface ocean velocity
field (u); 4) the offshore consolidated thin ice transport (T);
5) the coastline shape; and 6) the intersection of the polynya
ice edge with the coastline, all of which must be prescribed.
Frazil ice trajectories are determined via the free-drift ice
momentum balance. Analytical solutions for the polynya shape are
derived for a straight coastline in the special case when u, T,
and $\tau$ are uniform in the alongshore direction and the rotation
of the earth is neglected. When the latter constraint is
relaxed, an expression for the asymptotic uniform polynya width
is obtained. An expression for the alongshore adjustment length
scale of the polynya associated with alongshore variations in
the coastline shape, u, T, and $\tau$ is derived, with rotation of
the earth included. By considering a wedge-shaped ocean domain
in which the ocean velocity is nondivergent and irrotational it
is demonstrated that (i) a polynya solution does not always
exist and (ii) a point (S, say) can exist where the frazil ice
and thin ice transports are equal. When S exists, all possible
polynya ice edge curves will pass through this point. The model
is applied to simulate the wind-driven polynya that sometimes
forms off the northern Greenland coast during winter and early
spring between the Henrik Kr?yer Islands and the Ob Bank.
Because of fundamental couplings between the free parameters
listed above, one should be cautious in drawing inferences on
the physical behavior of the polynya. However, the model is
useful in revealing the sensitivity of the polynya to variations
in the prescribed forcing fields.},

This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics. We recommend training investigators in data presentation, encouraging a more complete presentation of data, and changing journal editorial policies.

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species' range limits and habitat suitability. Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

abstract = {The hope that ``biotechnology'' will permit the iden- tification
of geographic sources of recruitment to most marine animal
populations is not well supported either by logic or fact. First,
population genetics tells us that dispersal among geographic
populations is expected, at equilibrium, to eliminate the very
molecular genetic dif- ferences that are supposed to permit
identification of geo- graphic provenance. Second, studies of
allozynies and mitochondrial DNA have clearly shown that fish and
in- vertebrate species with planktotrophic larvae are genetic-
ally quite sindar over large regions, though not necessarily
throughout their whole ranges. Genetic studies are, nev-
ertheless, contributing new insights into the structure and
biology of marine animal populations. One new insight is that
sharp genetic subdivisions can occur in continuously distributed
species, particularly those spanning biogeographic boundaries. An
even more widespread observation is of very slight but
significant microgeographic genetic heterogeneity embedded within
broad regions of genetically very similar populations. Examples
of the latter from the California Current are presented for the
barnacle Balanirs glandula and the north- ern anchovy Engranlis
rnovdax. Microgeographic hetero- geneity holds interest for
biological oceanographers and fisheries scientists because it
contradicts the logic of pop- ulation genetics as well as
commonly held notions about the structure of zooplankton
populations. Evidence sug- gests that genetic heterogeneity on
nllcrogeographic scales results from temporal variation in the
genetic composi- tion of recruits. This temporal variation could
be a con- sequence of either selection on larval populations or
large variance in the reproductive success of individuals, owing
to chance matching of reproductive activity with win- dows of
oceanographic conditions conducive to fertil- ization, larval
development, retention, and recruitment. In support of the latter
hypothesis, effective sizes for natural oyster populations are
estimated to be only small fractions of breeding population
numbers. The tempo- ral aspect of population genetic structure
forges a strong interdisciplinary bridge to oceanographic
research aimed at elucidating the temporally and spatially
varying factors affecting recruitment.},

abstract = {Despite their ecological and economic importance, no summary of kelp global biogeography has been produced for almost two decades. The circumscription of the order Laminariales and familial and generic relationships in the group have changed considerably recently, in the light of molecular data. A global summary and geographical analysis of kelp species and their distributions (112 species in 33 genera) is presented. These data are analysed and discussed from the perspective of the new consensus of relationships within the group, and likely evolutionary events. The putative ancestors of the kelps occur and are overwhelmingly most diverse, in the cooler waters of northern Japan. The biogeographical evidence suggests three main lines of subsequent evolution: (a) a diversification producing the four ‘derived' families Alariaceae, Costariceae, Laminariaceae, and Lessoniaceae and most extant genera in the temperate northern Pacific, probably during the Miocene. (b) The evolution of an Arctic flora which invaded the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering Strait ca. 5.5 Ma. (c) At least four separate crossings, by different genera, of tropical regions from Northern to Southern Hemisphere (and one in the opposite direction). The recorded impacts of man on these distributions have thus far been minimal, with the notable exceptions of Undaria pinnatifida and species of Saccharina (grown in aquaculture systems for human food). Most genera are monospecific, with many confined to either the western or eastern temperate North Pacific, whereas the distribution of the most species-rich genera (Alaria, Laminaria, Saccharina) includes the Arctic, and they are widespread in the North Atlantic. This rapid species-level evolution is hypothesised to have been promoted by the relatively recent invasion of the Atlantic by these taxa. The crossing of the tropics has occurred in warm-temperate species some of which occur and are sometimes abundant, in deeper water in today's tropics, refuting the widespread view that kelps are only present in cold-water habitats. Most of these Southern Hemisphere kelps are in the family Lessoniaceae, including the only genus not present in the Northern Hemisphere, Lessonia. The origins of this genus are unclear. Knowledge of the phylogeography of the Ecklonia/Eisenia complex is particularly important in understanding Southern Hemisphere kelp biogeography. A number of groups are undergoing active speciation and, with the lack of a consistent species concept, the species-level taxonomy of the group remains to be clarified. There is a great need for molecular phylogeographical studies to provide evidence for many of the hypotheses presented here based on distributional evidence and the currently accepted taxonomic framework.},

abstract = {Kelp beds are thought to provide a refuge for a variety of marine organisms by damping waves, changing hydrodynamic flow, offering substrata for epiphytic species, and altering the abundances of predators and prey. At the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands, a typical flow-through system, kelp beds have the potential of acting as a prime habitat for a variety of pelagic species that would otherwise be swept away and lost from the island ecosystem. The current study investigates the effects of kelp beds on the abundance and composition of zooplankton and microphytoplankton, with the main aim of determining whether kelp beds act as a repository for larval stages in general, and for the swimming prawn, Nauticaris marionis, in particular. Salinity gradients created by freshwater run-off indicated that kelp beds at Marion Island retain surface water and restrict water exchange with the open ocean. Both the abundance and diversity of zooplankton were greatest within the kelp beds. This was partially due to the high abundance of kelp-associated species, but also to the apparent retention of naupliar larvae within the kelp canopy. Unlike the larvae of ostracods and copepods, caridean zoeae were rare, indicating that kelp beds are not a prime habitat for larvae of N. marionis. The larval retention mechanism for this species, therefore, remains unknown. Apart from retaining water and certain species of zooplankton, chlorophyll a/phaeopigment ratios confirmed the existence of a substantial detrital pool within the kelp beds. This retention of detritus may explain the observed importance of kelp-derived matter in the diet of many nearshore animals. In contrast to the zooplankton, kelp beds seemed to have little effect on the abundance and composition of microphytoplankton, and chlorophyll a values were low at all stations.},

highest for plants from the turbid habitat, lowest for deep

were largely attributable to variations in light-harvesting

responses also differed among populations. Population differences
in photosynthetic parameters resulted in different rates of
C-assimilation and growth by plants from shallow, deep, and

Along the exposed shores, plants are shorter and have narrower fronds. The change in morphology towards the low salinity areas is a clinal one and different morpho-logical types can be distinguished to a certain extent.

abstract = {Aim Global climate change has profound and diverse effects on biological diversity. Identifying present-day climate refugia is an increasingly recognized strategy for the management of biodiversity loss. Such refugia are potential safe havens that enhance environmental diversity by buffering the effects of large scale change, facilitating species persistence at regional scales and conserving unique genetic diversity. Although their ecological effects are well studied, the potential of upwelling centres to act as refugia in a scenario of climate warming remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate whether upwelled waters act as refugia in a region heavily affected by recent climatic changes. Location Shores of south-western Iberia and north-western Africa. Methods We compared changes in distribution of the canopy-forming macroalga Fucus guiryi with sea surface temperature patterns in five upwelling areas and adjacent warmer regions. Population diversity and structure was inferred from genotypic analyses using nine microsatellite loci. Results Fucus guiryi has disappeared from large expanses of non-upwelling shores, currently persisting in areas characterized by strong upwelling and reduced or non-significant rates of warming. Populations of F. guiryi were more abundant towards upwelling centres. Furthermore, the genetic characterization of populations revealed distinct genetic groups associated with each upwelling system. Main conclusions Within a large region of predominantly changing climate, we highlight the fundamental importance of upwelling areas as favourable, comparatively stable climates where F. guiryi has retreated and persists, preserving unique portions of the species' genetic pool.},

abstract = {Almost all juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae shelter beneath the urchin Parechinus angulosus. Field observations showed that all juvenile abalone remained concealed under urchins by day. Even by night, only 10-25{\%} left the protection of urchins to forage. Offered a choice of rocks or urchins in tide pools, the juveniles strongly preferred urchins rather than rocks. In aquaria, both urchins and abalone were active only at night. The frequency with which juvenile abalone left shelter was greatest if rocks constituted the only form of concealment, intermediate when they sheltered under urchins alone and least when the urchins had access to drift kelp. The treatment that provided abalone with both urchins and drift kelp had the lowest rate of urchin movement and the highest microalgal benthic standing stocks, the gut contents of the abalone comprised mainly kelp and their gut fullness indices were higher than in the other treatments. Concealment of juvenile abalone beneath urchins evidently provides them with several benefits. First, when urchins trap drift kelp, the abalone are capable of feeding on it and enhance their uptake of food. Second, this behaviour reduces the frequency with which juvenile abalone leave the shelter of urchins. Third, urchins that trap drift kelp reduce their rates of movement and their consumption of benthic microalgae, and we speculate that this may improve feeding conditions for the early postsettlement "recruit" stages of H. midae, and reduce the risk of Urchins "bulldozing" them. Thus, for a complex of reasons, the dependency of P. angulosus on drift kelp provides benefits to abalone that would not exist if this urchin acted as a conventional grazer. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

pressures for successful reproduction and inbreeding avoidance.
These species with limited seasonal reproductive opportunities
may use selfing as a means of reproductive assurance. We
quantified the frequency of selfing and the fitness consequences
for inbred versus outcrossed progeny of an annual kelp, the sea
palm (Postelsia palmaeformis). Using experimentally established
populations and microsatellite markers to assess the extent of
selfing in progeny from six founding parents, we found the
frequency of selfing was higher than expected in every
population, and few fitness costs were detected in selfed
offspring. Despite a decline in heterozygosity of 30 per cent in
the first generation of selfing, self-fertilization did not
affect individual size or reproduction, and correlated only with
a marginally significant decline in survival. Our results suggest
both that purging of deleterious recessive alleles may have
already occurred and that selfing may be key to reproductive
assurance in this species with limited dispersal. Postelsia has
an alteration of a free-living diploid and haploid stage, where
the haploid stage may provide increased efficiency for purging
the genetic load. This life history is shared by many seaweeds
and may thus be an important component of mating system evolution
in the sea.},

Kelp forests exhibit high rates of primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, support high levels of biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. Compared with many other regions, kelp forests around the UK have been largely understudied despite their recognised importance and the possible impacts of environmental change factors. We conducted surveys at 12 kelp-dominated open-coast sites within four regions in the UK, spanning {\~{}}??9?? in latitude and {\~{}}??3????C in mean sea temperature. We used a combination of quadrat-scale abundance and percent cover data as well as transect-scale canopy cover estimates to quantify ecological structure at multiple spatial scales. Kelp forest structure varied significantly between sites (nested within region) and also between regions. Regional-scale differences were principally driven by a higher abundance/cover of Alaria esculenta at the colder northern regions (i.e. north and west Scotland), and the presence of the Lusitanian kelp Laminaria ochroleuca at some sites in the southernmost region (i.e. southwest England) but nowhere else. The kelp Laminaria hyperborea dominated all sites and varied significantly between sites but not regions. All assemblage-level and population-level response variables were highly variable between sites within regions, suggesting that environmental factors varying at corresponding spatial scales (e.g. wave exposure, turbidity, sedimentation) are important drivers of pattern. The detection of regional-scale variability suggests that predicted changes in ocean climate, particularly increased sea temperature, may lead to changes in kelp forest structure in the future, with poleward range contractions (for A. esculenta) and expansions (for L. ochroleuca) likely. However, as the distribution-abundance patterns of the assemblage dominant L. hyperborea did not vary predictably with ocean temperature at this spatial scale, the fundamental structure of these habitats may be more influenced by localised factors, at least in the short-term. The relative importance of multiple, concurrent environmental change factors in structuring UK kelp forests remains largely unknown.},

turbulences and high pressures on a range of marine plastic
debris categories (various densities, degradation states and 15
shapes tested) in an experimental water column simulator tank and
pressure laboratory. Plastics deposited on North Sea strandlines
varied greatly spatially, as a function of material composition
and distance from source. Model outputs indicated that such dense
production pellets are likely transported up and down canyon as a
function of tidal forces, with only very minor net down canyon
movement. Behaviour of plastic frag20 ments under turbulence

density, playing major determining roles. Pressure was shown to
affect hydrodynamic behaviours of only low density foam plastics

abstract = {Excessive growth of seaweeds is a response of the biocenose, in a
particular biotope, to a supply of nutrients. This supply may be
natural or of anthropogenic origin. In the latter case, excessive
growths and drifts of algae are consequences of the disturbance
in the environment. Such growths are becoming increasingly
widespread as the result of the progressive eutrophication of
coastal waters, and now occur in at least twenty five countries
worldwide. For example, particularly significant accumulations of
seaweed are observed annually in Italy (1 000 000 t fresh
weight), France (100 000-200 000 t), and Australia (100 000-600
000 t). The densities range from 0.2 to 400 kg m(-2), the
thickness of the mats from 2 to 100 cm. The first part of the
present review describes the worldwide phenomenon and includes
information on the localities affected and the density, biomass,
annual production and harvesting time of the excessive algal
growths. The second part tries to analyse the phenomenon and the
problems posed by seaweed decay. Lagoons, bays and shallow
estuaries near industrial, agricultural and urban areas are most
affected by these increases in algal growth. In temperate waters,
excessive growth of macroalgae is generally observed during the
summer, while in tropical waters. it occurs during the winter. At
first, the development of opportunist and tolerant seaweeds acts
as a purifying system. Then, when the seaweed is stranded or the
environmental conditions become unfavourable, the plants die and
decompose. At this stage, a large biomass can become troublesome.
In summary, the impact on the environment is as follows: an
increase in the herbivore population, competition or toxicity
towards flora and fauna, alteration of the sediment, recycling of
nutrients and pollutants in the ecosystem, nuisance for local
residents and reduction of tourism. Cast weed is sometimes
collected from the beaches and dumped inland, but this method of
disposal merely constitutes a transfer of pollution.
Consequently, different ways of treatment were developed,
including composting and methanisation.},

occasions. Univariate statistics were used to test the hypothesis
of an outfall effect over and above variation between the control

the DDT metabolites DDE and DDD) were detected in oysters across
the entire sampling period. Due to the low frequency or low mean
concentrations of organochlorines an impact versus control
comparison was not feasible for this study. Mean concentrations
of trace metals in oysters were highly variable across all
sampling periods. No obvious changes in the contaminant
concentrations were noticed over time. Statistical comparisons of

Location An approximately 1000 km stretch of New Zealand's

dispersal dynamics of rafted specimens. Results were examined
using principal components analysis (PCA) in order to determine
spatial groupings. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was
used to determine statistical support for the detected spatial

genetic assemblages, which probably reflect broad oceanographic
features. In particular, the north–south genetic partitioning in
rafted kelp assemblages either side of the Cape Campbell region
in central New Zealand closely corresponds to an
oceanographically mediated disjunction previously observed in a
number of larval-dispersed marine invertebrate taxa. Main

drifting kelp rafts and planktonic invertebrate larvae may be
similarly constrained by oceanographic features, and demonstrate
how the phylogenetic structure present in populations of D.

abstract = {* Underwater visual census (UVC) using SCUBA is a commonly used method for assessing reef fish communities. Evidence suggests, however, that fish avoid divers due to the sound of bubbles produced by open-circuit SCUBA, and avoidance behaviour is more pronounced as fishing pressure increases. Despite the potential for producing biased counts and conclusions, these behavioural effects have rarely been quantified, especially when assessing the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). * To test the magnitude of avoidance behaviour, we surveyed fish populations inside and outside two MPAs in Guam, using two diving systems: standard open-circuit (OC) SCUBA and a closed-circuit rebreather (CCR) that produces no bubbles. Data were collected using a diver-operated stereo-video system (stereo-DOV), which provided counts of relative abundance, measures of fish length and the minimum approach distance of the diver to a fish. * Inside MPAs, fish surveys conducted with CCR recorded similar community metrics to fish surveys conducted with conventional OC SCUBA. In contrast, outside the MPAs, the bubble-free diving system recorded 48{\%} more species and up to 260{\%} greater fish abundance. These differences reflected the ability of a diver wearing the silent CCR unit to sample the larger, most heavily targeted species that are shy of divers in fished areas. This difference was also large enough to change some results from ‘reject' to ‘accept' the null hypothesis of ‘no significant differences exist between fished and protected areas'. * The use of CCR for fish surveys clearly minimizes behavioural biases associated with fish avoiding open-circuit SCUBA divers. We recommend the use of this bubble-free diving system for surveys assessing reef fish populations, especially in areas where fish are heavily targeted by spearfishing. If fish behaviour is not accounted for, surveys using SCUBA could result in erroneous conclusions when comparing fished and protected areas. While the behaviour of fish towards divers is rarely mentioned in conclusions from studies using UVC, it is an important source of bias that should be acknowledged and minimized where possible.},

@phdthesis{Blamey2010-zx,
abstract = {An eastward shift in the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii
took place in the early 1990s along the south-west coast of South
Africa in an area known as East of Cape Hangklip (EOCH). Given
the predatory capabilities of J. lalandii, an intricate
relationship between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and juvenile
abalone Haliotis midae, and an already over-exploited ecosystem,
the lobster `invasion' is assumed to have had serious
consequences on the benthic community and associated fisheries.
To investigate these effects, I used both empirical and modelling
approaches. Based on field studies, I first analysed temporal
changes in rock lobsters and the benthic community at two
lobster-invaded sites EOCH. Prior to 1990, rock lobsters were
rare EOCH, but from the mid 1990s onwards they achieved densities
of 0.4- 0.8 m-2. The pre-invaded benthic community was
significantly different from the post- invaded community at both
sites. Three major changes followed the lobster invasion: (1) a
decline or even a disappearance of herbivores (a direct effect),
(2) macroalgal proliferation (an indirect effect) and (3)
increases of a range of sessile taxa (unknown effect). This was
followed by a detailed spatial analysis of J. lalandii densities
and the benthic community EOCH, in which I surveyed six sites
(three invaded and three non- invaded) at three different depth
zones ({\textless}5 m, 6-12 m and 13-20 m). At all three depth zones Jasus
lalandii was significantly more abundant in invaded areas than in
non- invaded areas, and invaded and non-invaded benthic
communities were significantly different. Invaded sites were
characterized by higher densities of rock lobsters, macroalgae
and sessile species, whereas non-invaded sites had greater
amounts of herbivores and encrusting corallines. Abalone
abundance reflected their previously- University Of Cape Town
recorded dependency on urchins and the effects of rampant
poaching. Floral species diversity was on average greater at
invaded sites and increased with depth, whereas faunal species
diversity was greater at non-invaded sites but also increased
with depth. The depths in which strongest effects of J. lalandii
were felt coincided with the depth of maximum abundance of the
urchin Parechinus angulosus, the abalone Haliotis midae, the kelp
Ecklonia maxima and encrusting corallines. In line with an
ecosystem approach to fisheries management and to better
understand the ecosystem dynamics EOCH, a lobster-urchin-abalone
Minimally Realistic Model was developed for a lobster-invaded
area, and an adjacent non- invaded area. A key feature of the
model is that its focus was restricted to the critical
interactions of interest and was fitted to all available data. An
existing abalone stock- assessment model formed the foundation of
this multispecies model, to which rock lobsters and urchins were
added. Abalone and rock lobsters were modelled using age-
structured production models and urchins were modelled using a
simpler surplus production model because of data limitations. The
model estimated a lobster starting biomass (in 1985) of 314
tonnes (MT) and a carrying capacity of 1511 MT. Species-
interaction parameters, particularly the lobster-abalone
interaction, were difficult to estimate and the model was unable
to estimate the urchin intrinsic growth rate parameter because
the data had insufficient contrast. Results from the model
suggest that the lobster invasion was probably caused by an
influx of adult lobsters as opposed to increased larval
settlement. Future projections suggest that given the virtual
disappearance of urchins, complete removal of rock lobsters would
be needed to allow the urchin population to re-establish itself.
Recovery of urchins could take up to 50 years and recovery of
abalone would take even longer. The model-predicted differences
in lobsters, abalone and urchins between invaded and non-invaded
areas paralleled empirical data. Further model explorations
included (1) a hypothetical lobster invasion into a currently
non-invaded zone EOCH and (2) the addition of a top fish predator
into a lobster-invaded zone. Various hypothetical lobster
invasions into the non-invaded zone all resulted in the eventual
disappearance of urchins and, consequently, juvenile abalone.
Available catch and effort data for fish indicated that a major
decline in linefish has taken place, but that this occurred prior
to the 1980s and was thus not the direct cause of the
rock-lobster invasion. This was supported by outputs of a model
University Of Cape Town incorporating fish predation, which
demonstrated that the presently over-exploited fish biomass has
very little effect on the rock lobster population, but that at
historical pristine levels, fish would have been capable of
preventing the establishment of a dense rock-lobster population
and the consequent disappearance of urchins and abalone. These
results indicate that the over-fishing of top-predators would
have had massive ramifications for the rest of the ecosystem.
Through dual empirical and modelling approaches, my study
highlights the complexity of ecosystem interactions and the need
for multispecies models in developing an ecosystem approach to
fisheries management, and adds to the understanding of the causes
and implications of human- and environmentally-induced shifts in
community structure},

studies of material flows in a shallow ecosystem compared to the
open ocean. In: P. Lasserre and J.M. Martin (eds),
Biogeochemical Processes at the Land-Sea Boudndary. Elsevier,
Amsterdam. Two nitrogen flow simulation models are presented to
contrast the effects of horizontal water transport which is
believed to be important in shallow-water marine systems, with
vertical transport in an open ocean plankton community,
including the microplankton. A kelp-bed community dominated by
filter feeders is modelled as a closed system with no transport,
and under both upwelling and downwelling conditions. In the
closed system, feedback of organic nitrogen through detritus
formation from animal faeces is important in the maintenance of
a food supply, a situation analogous to closed bays and
estuaries. Under upwelling conditions, surface water transports
material out of the system and cool, clear upwelling water
dilutes the suspension of detritus. Under downwelling conditions
when phytoplankton-rich water from offshore is imported,
phytoplankton supplements the detrital diet of shallow-water
filter-feeders and their growth is faster; this situation
parallels that found on exposed rocky intertidal shores. A
nitrogen flow model of a microplankton community is used to
investigate the effect of sedimentation out of the mixed layer.
The simulation shows a series of peaks of phytoplankton,
bacteria, zooflagellates, larger protozoa and micro-and
meso-zooplankton over a 13-day period after an upwelling or
mixing event. Two phytoplankton peaks develop, corresponding to
``new'' and ``regenerated'' production respectively. Increasing
rates of sedimentation of phytoplankton and zooplankton faeces
out of the mixed layer result in slightly slower development of
the bloom, flattened and smaller peaks of all components,
increasing relative importance of ``regenerated'' production,
and maintenance of a larger phytoplankton P/B ratio. The series
of peaks in the model suggests that different components of the
community may dominate the biomass at different successional
stages in the development of a bloom. This may help to resolve
the controversy over the significance of micro-organisms in the
plankton community.},

abstract = {Laminaria pallida and Ecklonia maxima are large, commercially
valuable kelps that co-dominate inshore waters of the west coast
of Southern Africa in a geographically changing pattern. In the
south, E. maxima dominates and forms a canopy in shallow waters
({\textless} about 5 m deep), with L. pallida forming a sub-canopy and
extending down to 20 m or more. Northward along the Southern
African coast and into Namibia, E. maxima is progressively
replaced by L. pallida. Corresponding with this change in
dominance, L. pallida shows certain morphological changes along
the south-to-north geographical gradient. To explain these
phenomena, we examined a range of morphological characters in
both kelps (stipe length, stipe weight, stipe outer diameter,
stipe inner diameter, length of hollow section in the stipe, and
frond weight), and various environmental factors (seawater
temperature, seawater turbidity, cloud/fog data, daylength, and
wave and wind data). Our results, based on measurements at seven
sites along 1600 km of coast between Cape Town and Swakopmund
(Namibia), quantified and confirmed the change in dominance and
the northward increase in stipe hollowness in L. pallida. The
morphology of E. maxima did not change with latitude. Water
turbidity, wind speed, and wave height differed significantly
along the coast. However, only turbidity showed a steady trend,
increasing northward in terms of all indicators (chlorophyll a,
particulate inorganic carbon, particulate organic carbon) while
wind speed and wave height showed a generally decreasing trend.
Furthermore, the hollowness of L. pallida was also not related to
the flexibility of the stipes. Our results suggest that L.
pallida sporophytes may progressively outcompete E. maxima
northward, perhaps because they are more low-light tolerant, and
we suggest that by developing a hollow stipe, the sporophytes may
grow faster in length, potentially increasing their competitive
advantage in the shallow water where they must compete with
sporophytes of E. maxima.},

The variation in phlorotannin concentration within and among individual seaweed specimens of the same species can be substantial, and seaweeds may respond to herbivore damage by an increased production of phlorotannins in order to prevent further herbivory. In the present study, we investigated the natural variation of phlorotannins in different parts of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea in an observational field survey. We also performed a manipulative induction experiment in which we studied the effect of natural grazing by the patellid limpet Ansates (=Helcion) pellucida and the littorinid snail Lacuna vincta, as well as artificial damage on the production of phlorotannins in L. hyperborea. There was a large variation in phlorotannin content both among and within L. hyperborea individuals and populations. The control plants in the induction experiment had a higher phlorotannin content compared to plants in natural populations, but grazing by A. pellucida or L. vincta, or artificial damage did not induce a higher phlorotannin concentration in the kelps. Instead, the phlorotannin content in wounded kelps was significantly lower than in the control plants, possibly due to removal of phlorotannin-rich outer layers of the kelp thallus, or to an induced compensatory growth response in the L. hyperborea plants. These results imply that L. hyperborea phlorotannins probably do not function as an inducible chemical defense against A. pellucida and L. vincta, instead grazing by these herbivores decreases the phlorotannin content of the kelps.},

abstract = {In comparison with terrestrial plants the mechanistic knowledge of chemical defences is poor for marine macroalgae. This restricts our understanding in the chemically mediated interactions that take place between algae and other organisms. Technical advances such as metabolomics, however, enable new approaches towards the characterisation of the chemically mediated interactions of organisms with their environment. We address defence responses in the red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla using mass spectrometry based metabolomics in combination with bioassays. Being invasive in the north Atlantic this alga is likely to possess chemical defences according to the prediction that well-defended exotics are most likely to become successful invaders in systems dominated by generalist grazers, such as marine macroalgal communities. We investigated the effect of intense herbivore feeding and simulated herbivory by mechanical wounding of the algae. Both processes led to similar changes in the metabolic profile. Feeding experiments with the generalist isopod grazer Idotea baltica showed that mechanical wounding caused a significant increase in grazer resistance. Structure elucidation of the metabolites of which some were up-regulated more than 100 times in the wounded tissue, revealed known and novel eicosanoids as major components. Among these were prostaglandins, hydroxylated fatty acids and arachidonic acid derived conjugated lactones. Bioassays with pure metabolites showed that these eicosanoids are part of the innate defence system of macroalgae, similarly to animal systems. In accordance with an induced defence mechanism application of extracts from wounded tissue caused a significant increase in grazer resistance and the up-regulation of other pathways than in the activated defence. Thus, this study suggests that G. vermiculophylla chemically deters herbivory by two lines of defence, a rapid wound-activated process followed by a slower inducible defence. By unravelling involved pathways using metabolomics this work contributes significantly to the understanding of activated and inducible defences for marine macroalgae.},

Maximum uptake rates found were: V 30 ??M0-1 h=73.8 ??mol NO 3 g -1 DW h -1 and V 3 ??M0-1 h=16.7 ??mol PO 4 g -1 DW h -1, in the two thinnest Porphyra. We found that the nitrate uptake rates were significantly greater at 30 ??M than 3 ??M NO 3 concentration, and that the uptake rates decreased with time of exposure. Temperature (5, 15, and 25??C) did not have as strong an effect on nitrate uptake rates as did nutrient concentration. Q 10 values and uptake rates at four different nitrate concentrations indicated that nutrient uptake at 5??C was initially an active process. After 24 h, the processes involved appeared passive as Q 10 values were between 1.0 and 1.3 and nitrate uptake curves were linear. Nitrate uptake rates correlated positively with the surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio. No coherent trends were found for uptake of phosphate, except that the uptake rates were significantly higher in 30 ??M NO 3 medium as opposed to 3 ??M NO 3. We did not find any significant difference in uptake rate and pattern between the summer species Porphyra purpurea (Roth.) C.

abstract = {Replicated ecological studies in marine reserves and associated unprotected areas are valuable in examining top-down impacts on communities and the ecosystem-level effects of fishing. We carried out experimental in two temperate marine reserves to examine these top-down influences on shallow subtidal reef communities in northeastern New Zealand. Both reserves examined are known to support high densities of predators and tethering experiments showed that the chance of predation on the dominant sea urchin, Evechinus chloroticus, within both reserves was approximately 7 times higher relative to outside. Predation was most intense on the smallest size class (30-40 mm) of tethered urchins, the size at which urchins cease to exhibit cryptic behaviour. A high proportion of predation on large urchins could be attributed to the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Predation on the smaller classes was probably by both lobsters and predatory fish, predominantly the sparid Pagrus auratus. The density of adult Evechinus actively razing the substratum in the urchin barrens habitat was found to be significantly lower at marine reserve sites (2.2+/-0.3 m(-2)) relative to non-reserve sites (5.5+/-0.4 m(-2)). There was no difference in the density of cryptic juveniles between reserve and non-reserve sites. Reserve populations were more bimodal, with urchins between 40 and 55 mm occurring at very low numbers. Experimental removal of Evechinus from the urchin barrens habitat over 12 months lead to a change from a crustose coralline algal habitat to a macroalgal dominated habitat. Such macroalgal habitats were found to be more extensive in both reserves, where urchin densities were lower, relative to the adjacent unprotected areas that were dominated by urchin barrens. The patterns observed provide evidence for a top-down role of predators in structuring shallow reef communities in northeastern New Zealand and demonstrate how marine reserves can reverse the indirect effects of fishing and re-establish community-level trophic cascades.},

Observations in Bahı ´a Tortugas were made quarter- ly from January 1997 to September 1998 using SCU- BA diving surveys. No macroscopic plants were found in the Bahı ´a Tortugas area from October 1997 to April 1998, a local absence of at least 7 months. Aerial surveys further suggest regional dis- appearance along most of the Baja California coast during the event. Unexpectedly, plants were found in Bahı ´a Tortugas again in July 1998, in spite of the widespread disappearance of the species less than a year earlier. Long-distance spore dispersal was an unlikely cause of the recruitment because: 1) the nearest spore source was more than 100 km away; 2) recruitment appeared to be simultaneous at many sites and occurred rapidly after the cessation of the ENSO event; and 3) the recruits occurred in the same areas as before disappearance. We suggest that a microscopic stage that was not visible during dive surveys survived the stressful conditions of ENSO and caused the recruitment event, supporting the hypothesis that a bank of microscopic forms can sur- vive conditions stressful to macroscopic algae},

abstract = {The present study combines methods that were designed to infer intraspecific relationships (e.g. nested-clade analysis (NCA), mismatch distributions and maximum likelihood gene flow analysis) to analyse historic events and recurrent processes in the cryptic mud snail species Hydrobia acuta and H. glyca. Specifically, we test the proposed allopatry of cryptic species and whether the peculiar range-subdivision of the putative subspecies H. a. acuta and H. a. neglecta is a result of long-distance dispersal or continuous range expansion. The NCA indicates a past fragmentation of the two H. acuta subspecies as well as past fragmentations within H. glyca. Gene-flow analyses show extensive gene flow in an E-W direction (towards the Atlantic) in the Mediterranean H. a. acuta, generally low gene flow in a W-E direction in the Atlantic H. a. neglecta and complex gene-flow pattern in a N-S but also in a S-N direction (against the Gulf Stream) in H. glyca. Based on these data and supportive ecological and oceanographical data, we hypothesize that the separation of the two H. acuta subspecies was not caused by long-distance dispersal but by a range shift and/or range expansion of the closely related competitor H. glyca as a result of an interglacial warming with a subsequent range shift in H. acuta. Moreover, our data do not show evidence for a long-term, stable sympatry of Hydrobia species, supporting the concept of allopatric relationships within cryptic radiations. NCA and gene-flow analyses indicate that the only sympatric population found in our study is the result of a recent dispersal event from the nearby Mediterranean. It is assumed that allopatric relationships in ephemeral Hydrobia populations constitute an evolutionary advantage relative to competition, recruitment and re-establishment of habitats. Mechanisms that could be of relevance for maintaining allopatry are discussed.},

This paper discusses New Zealand populations of M. pyrifera

correlated closely with the Southland Current. In New Zealand,
M. pyrifera does not persist in areas where maximum temperatures
exceed 18?19°C for several days, and where the warmest monthly
isothere does not exceed 16?17°C. An apparent easterly
retraction of Macrocystis distribution within Cook Strait since

slight warming in ambient sea surface temperature over the last
forty years is discussed. The intolerance of the kelp to extreme
temperatures above 18?19°C was confirmed by experimental
transplantation of kelp plants within Queen Charlotte Sound.
Collectively these observations suggest M. pyrifera may indicate
patches of relatively cool water, and on a very small geographic
scale. In an area such as the Marlborough Sounds, clearly close
to the plant's limits of distribution, the presence of
Macrocystis may be useful in considering potential sites for
locating net cages for the commercial ?ranching? of chinook

abstract = {Modification of the coastal environment by human activities often leads to an increase in sedimentation of nearshore waters, with potential impacts on benthic marine assemblages. Here we assess the relationships between the levels of sedimentation, wave exposure and benthic organisms on rocky intertidal platforms around the Kaikoura Peninsula in southern New Zealand. We designed and tested five sediment traps to provide a tool for measuring the relative abundance of sediment across sites. Using field- and laboratory-based experiments, we tested hypotheses concerning whether different levels of sedimentation affected algal germling survival and algal zygote attachment, and whether the interactions of grazers and sediments affected germling survival. Levels of sediment and exposure were inversely related across seven sites. The fucoid alga Hormosira banksii characterized the more sedimented wave-sheltered and intermediately wave-exposed sites, with up to 80{\%} cover in the lower mid-tidal zone, while the bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica characterized the three most wave-exposed sites. Grazing molluscs were found across all sites but species abundances varied by sediment and exposure levels. We did two 11-day trials testing the effects of different levels of sediment and different species of molluscan grazers on the survival of 1-week-old Hormosira germlings. Generally, there was no significant treatment effect of grazers, but mortality varied considerably among sites. In particular, one site had very high levels of sediment, which resulted in 100{\%} mortality of germlings across all grazer treatments. Removing sediment at 1-week, 2-week and 4-week intervals made no difference to the survival of Hormosira germlings. In laboratory-based experiments, a light dusting of sediment reduced the percentage of zygotes of Hormosira by 34{\%} and Durvillaea by 71{\%} that attached to primary substratum, and a complete cover of sediment prevented attachment altogether. Overall, the effects of sediments and its interaction with molluscan grazing were highly variable but often large, particularly on the attachment of zygotes to primary substratum. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Wave action on exposed rocky coasts can be severe, generating
large hydrodynamic forces that have been proposed to constrain
the size of intertidal animals and plants. In contrast, flows
subtidally are more benign, and organisms, particularly seaweeds,
may grow quite large. The large dimensions of these flexible
macroalgae allow them to move during much or most of a passing
wave cycle, reducing relative water velocities and modifying the
forces the plants must endure. The consequences of such
wave-induced motion are explored for the stipitate understory
kelps Eisenia arborea and Pterygophora californica using a
numerical model that approximates these seaweeds as vertically
oriented cantilever beams subjected to lateral hydrodynamic
forces acting at their stipe tips. Bending moments and peak
stresses induced in the stipes of these species during the
passage of waves are calculated as functions of plant size and
shape and of water depth and sea state. Model predictions for a
subset of conditions are validated against real-time measurements
of bending moments acting on a Pterygophora individual in the
field. The results suggest that the allometric patterns of growth
exhibited by Eisenia and Pterygophora can greatly reduce the
stresses generated in the stipes of these plants relative to
isometric growth. Low stipe stiffness acts as a general,
particularly effective, stress-lowering mechanism. The dynamic
swaying associated with this low stiffness can also modulate the
magnitudes of peak stresses induced in the stipes of these kelps.
In particular, in shallow water under large waves, dynamic
loading can substantially increase induced stress, suggesting
that plant motion is an important factor affecting the loading
regime encountered by these organisms.},

Other analyses yield insight into flow-mediated species interactions within kelp forests. In each case, advances emerge from the use of ecomechanical approaches that propagate physical-biological connections at the scale of the individual to higher levels of ecological organization.

abstract = {For more than a century, coastal wetlands have been recognized
for their ability to stabilize shorelines and protect coastal
communities. However, this para- digm has recently been called
into question by small-scale experimental evidence. Here, we
conduct a literature review and a small meta-analysis of wave
attenua- tion data, and we find overwhelming evidence in support
of established theory. Our review suggests that mangrove and salt
marsh vegetation afford context-dependent protection from
erosion, storm surge, and potentially small tsunami waves. In
bio- physical models, field tests, and natural experiments, the
presence of wetlands reduces wave heights, property damage, and
human deaths. Meta-analysis of wave attenuation by vegetated and
unvegetated wetland sites highlights the critical role of
vegetation in attenuating waves. Although we find coastal wetland
vegetation to be an effective shoreline buffer, wetlands cannot
protect shorelines in all loca- tions or scenarios; indeed
large-scale regional erosion, river meandering, and large tsunami
waves and storm surges can overwhelm the attenuation effect of
vegetation. However, due to a nonlinear relationship between wave
attenuation and wetland size, even small wetlands afford
substantial protection from waves. Combining man- made structures
with wetlands in ways that mimic nature is likely to increase
coastal protection. Oyster domes, for example, can be used in
combination with natural wetlands to protect shorelines and
restore critical fishery habitat. Finally, coastal wetland
vegetation modifies shorelines in ways (e.g. peat accretion) that
increase shoreline integrity over long timescales and thus
provides a lasting coastal adaptation measure that can protect
shorelines against accelerated sea level rise and more frequent
storm inundation. We conclude that the shoreline protection
paradigm still stands, but that gaps remain in our knowledge
about the mechanistic and context- dependent aspects of shoreline
protection.},

In a series of experiments on recruitment of invertebrates, I partitioned the habitat-modifying effects of kelp into their positive and negative effects. Experiments revealed that a reduction of light intensity and removal of sediment by canopies acted to facilitate recruitment, but physical abrasion by the canopy acted as a negative force to overpower these positive effects. Understorey assemblages, therefore, represent biased subsets of taxa from a local pool capable of colonization. On balance, negative effects acted to exclude invertebrates from the understorey community. The asymmetric strength of negative effects not only explains the enigma of exclusion but also indicates that, when it exists, understorey coexistence with canopy plants must reflect a more even match between positive and negative effects.},

@article{Dayton1975,
abstract = {The mechanisms by which various species exert influence disproportionate to their abundance or mass on the structure of a lower intertidal algal community were evaluated experimentally. These functional roles were evaluated by various controlled manipulations at seven stations along the Washington coastline ranked according to an exposure/desiccation gradient. The algae were divided into three categories: canopy species, which grow above the other species and apparently succeed in competitively dominating the light resources as dem- onstrated by algal blooms following their removal; obligate understory species, which die after the canopy species are removed; and fugitive species, which are quick to colonize new space. Ecological dominance was exerted in areas of moderate wave exposure by Hedophyllum sessile, which competitively displaces a large number of fugitive algal species and which fur- nishes a protected habitat for many obligate understory algae that die or defoliate after the removal of Hedophyllum. Hedophyllum loses this dominance in the most exposed areas, al- though such sites apparently represent its physiologically optimal habitat, because in these areas it is out-competed by Laminaria setchellii and Lessoniopsis littoralis. In these wave ex- posed habitats Lessoniopsis was demonstrated to exert a strong competitive dominance over all the other species in the association. The molluscan herbivores were not observed to express any measurable effects on the recruitment or survival of the algae. However, the echinoid Strongylocentrotus purpuratus often overexploits its prey and has a pronounced influence on most of the algal species. In this respect S. purpuratus enjoys an important community role singular among the many herbivores. Similarly, Pycnopodia helianthoides and Anthopleura xanthogrammica are dis- proportionately important carnivores, because their predation on Strongylocentrotus, clear- ing large areas of urchins, results in patches in which algal succession follows. The rate of algal succession following removal of the dominant algal species or of Strongy- locentrotus is proportional to the degree of wave exposure. The Hedophyllum canopy recovery at the Eagle Point area of San Juan Island, a site exposed to relatively little wave action and thus high levels of desiccation, was relatively slow, with only 1O{\%}-26{\%} cover reestablished after 3 yr. In contrast, Hedophyllum canopy developed up to 66{\%} cover in only 1 yr in the exposed area of Waadah Island; it then quickly lost its dominance to Laminaria and Lessoniop- sis. Algal succession in deeper Portage Head tidepools was found to be relatively slow with no clear dominance expressed after 5 yr.},

the drag on the organism is characterized, it is traditionally
this mean force that is cited. Important information is lost,

exposed to the same mainstream flow; the sphere and limpet
exhibit larger fluctuations than the plate and cylinders. The

likelihood that an organism will be dislodged. For organisms in
which the applied fluid-dynamic stress is near the mean breaking
stress (e.g. some corals, trees and mussels), calculations made

water masses in an estuary is critical to understanding the
movement and recruitment patterns of planktonic propagules and
how these patterns relate to the distribution and abundance of
adults. Forests of bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) are complex
three-dimensional habitats that can support tightly linked
trophic interactions between primary producers, herbivores, and
carnivores. Therefore, the spatial distribution of this
important habitat can affect local food webs. Kelp forests in
Kachemak Bay, Alaska, were mapped from 2000 to 2002 using
low-altitude aerial photography. Over the 3 years, kelp forests
were found only in the outer basin, and only a few attached
sporophytes were found in the turbid and lower-salinity inner
basin. Many biotic and abiotic factors can affect the dispersal
and development of kelp. We tested the hypothesis that decreased
salinity and light intensity in the inner basin limit the
spatial distribution of Nereocystis sporophytes in this system.
Transplant experiments were conducted between the marine and
estuarine endpoints of kelp forest distribution. These
experiments suggest that the growth of Nereocystis sporophytes
transplanted from the marine to the estuarine endpoint was
impeded, but that they could survive under estuarine conditions.
We tested a second hypothesis, that estuarine circulation
patterns control Nereocystis sporophyte distribution.
Hydrographic measurements and circulation studies suggest that a
strong baroclinic jet develops in the late summer and fall and
may prevent Nereocystis spore dispersal into the inner basin.
The cyclonic surface circulation in the outer basin may
contribute to the observed spatial distribution of kelp forests
in this system.},

amounts of detritus, most of which is exported to areas where it
can constitute an important trophic subsidy or potentially be
sequestered in marine sediments. Knowing the vertical transport
speed of detrital particles is critical to understanding the
potential magnitude and spatial extent of these linkages. We
measured sinking speeds for Laminaria hyperborea detritus ranging
from whole plants to small fragments and sea urchin faecal
pellets, capturing the entire range of particulate organic matter
produced by kelp forests. Under typical current conditions, we
determined that this organic material can be transported 10 s of
m to 10 s of km. We show how the conversion of kelp fragments to
sea urchin faeces, one of the most pervasive processes in kelp
forests globally, increases the dispersal potential of detritus
by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Kelp detritus sinking speeds were
also faster than equivalent phytoplankton, highlighting its
potential for rapid delivery of carbon to deep areas. Our
findings support arguments for a significant contribution from
kelp forests to subsidizing deep sea communities and the global
carbon sink.},

abstract = {The high marine species diversity in the Indo-West Pacific declines sharply to the cast and west of the Indonesian Archipelago. This biogeographic pattern has attracted attention for over a century, but the mechanisms generating such diversity gradients remain uncertain. Molecular genetic data can help address biogeographic mechanisms in at least 4 ways. They can provide (1) independent evidence for genetic boundaries between cryptic species, (2) a temporal framework for species divergence times, (3) phylogenetic reconstructions of species divergence patterns, and (4) information about the geography of allelic variants within species. Data from mitochondrial DNA variation in Pacific sea urchins show that (1) congeneric species are of recent origin, having diverged within the Pleistocene, (2) populations are genetically heterogeneous despite high dispersal potential, and (3) clines of mtDNA variation within species are similar to diversity clines in the entire fauna. Phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA variants does not support the center-of-overlap or center-of-accumulation models for biogeographic patterns in the Indo-West Pacific, but instead suggests that genetic differentiation and perhaps species formation can occur throughout the Indo-West Pacific.},

coastline and uniform cross-shelf bottom slope, seven different
cross-shelf open boundary conditions (four of which are applied
in either implicit or explicit form) are compared in three
numerical experiments. 1) A mound of water is allowed to
collapse and radiate waves toward the open boundaries. 2) A
uniform alongshelf wind stress is applied at zero time over the
entire shelf and held constant for the duration of the
experiment. 3) A uniform cross-shelf wind stress is applied at
zero time over the entire shelf and held constant for the
duration of the experiment. The boundary condition which is most
transparent to waves consists of a sponge at the outer edge of
the model domain with an Orlanski radiation condition at the
outer edge of the sponge. Several open boundary conditions
perform adequately in the wind stress experiments, but the
Orlanski radiation condition alone (without a sponge) appears to
give the best total performance (of these tested) through all of
the experiments. It is adequate at transmitting wave energy, and
its response is entirely acceptable in the wind stress
experiments. The results suggest that a clamped open boundary is
probably the worst choice of cross-shelf open boundary condition
for barotropic coastal models. In fact, any open boundary
condition which significantly restricts the cross-shelf open
boundary should probably be avoided.},

environments on earth, wave-swept rocky shores support a highly

a unique opportunity for exploration of the role of extreme water

described by which the maximal water velocity and acceleration

maximal hydrodynamic forces are calculated. These forces can
limit the range and foraging activity of some species, and can
determine the rate of disturbance in others, but in general,
wave-swept organisms have surprisingly high factors of safety.
This apparent over-design can help to explain the diversity of

mechanics can limit the ability of natural selection to guide
specialization. Although flow itself may commonly be prohibited

Recent reports suggest that rock lobsters (Jasus lalandii) have increased substantially in the region where the commercial abalone fishery is centered. This increase has been blamed for a recorded collapse of urchin populations and dramatic reductions in the numbers of juvenile abalone. We verified the substantial increase in rock lobster abundance there. Surveys covering 200 km of coastline showed that densities of urchins were negatively correlated with those of large lobsters 68 mm carapace length) and that densities of juvenile abalone were positively correlated with those of urchins. The indirect negative effects of rock lobsters on juvenile abalone clearly pose a major threat to the abalone industry, already under stress from poaching. Quantification of the relationship between juvenile abalone and urchins and between urchins and rock lobsters allows a forecast of the magnitude of lobster harvesting necessary to reduce them to a level at which urchins may recover and sustain juvenile abalone.

the year. Neither erosion nor dislodgement was correlated with
water velocity (as often proposed), and this finding contradicts
the common assumption that high dislodgement rates during peak
wave action account for the bulk of detrital production. Together
with low growth, the high erosion rate led to a severe reduction
of individual kelp biomass in autumn (from 600 g to 300 g fresh
weight kelp−1), reducing drag forces on kelp thalli by ∼ 50{\%},
likely reducing their susceptibility to dislodgement during peak
wave action. Instead, a pulse of detrital production coincided

erosion, and that the ensuing changes in kelp morphology decouple
detrital production from the wave-action forces.},

Australia rose to unprecedented levels during February and March
2011, and this warming event has been termed a ``marine heat
wave''. While surface temperatures were more than 3°C above the
long-term monthly average over an extended area in February 2011,
the temperature in some localised areas in coastal waters
exceeded the long-term monthly average by 5°C for periods of a
day or two in late February/early March. * A scientific Workshop
was organised on Thursday 5 May, 2011 to review the oceanic
processes and biological/fisheries consequences of the heat wave
and to provide a means for capturing much of the anecdotal
information. * This heat wave, which coincided with an extremely
strong La Ni{\~{n}}a event and a record strength Leeuwin Current, is
viewed as a major temperature anomaly superimposed on the
underlying long-term ocean-warming trend. * While sudden changes
in water temperature have been recorded in waters off the Western
Australian coast in the past, there have been no previous records
of such strongly elevated temperatures. * Biological effects
reported to date include fish and invertebrate deaths, extensions
and contractions in species distributions, variations in
recruitment and growth-rates, impacts on trophic relationships
and community structure, and variations in catch rates of
exploited species. * As such, the elevated water temperatures
were viewed as resulting either in mortality or in a variety of
``sub-lethal'' effects, both of which can have either short or
long-term implications. * These observed and expected biological
consequences are based primarily on anecdotal information
collected during or directly after the passage of the heat wave.
However, as results from ongoing research and monitoring programs
become available, a more comprehensive and considered view of the
effects will be forthcoming in the form of peer-reviewed journal
papers. * While widespread mortality of fish and invertebrates
were reported, none were shown to be attributable to disease. *
It appears that the incursions of large volumes of silt-laden
water from river outflows into the adjacent coastal waters of the
mid-west coast between Dongara and NW Cape following the passage
of the tropical cyclone Bianca in late January are also likely to
have contributed to the mortality experienced by the marine biota
of that region. * While the nature of the impacts will to a large
extent dictate the type and degree of management response, most
of the fishery responses identified in this report are currently
covered in the ongoing monitoring and assessment protocols in
place in the Department of Fisheries, noting that in particular,
the response to mortality events is a well co-ordinated,
interdepartmental process. * The two most urgent ``Fisheries
Management'' actions are (a) the need to review the management
(and future monitoring) arrangements for Area 8 of the Roe's
abalone fishery, and (b) to determine the consequences of any
additional mortality of the 2010 rock lobster puerulus

Time and logistical difficulties often preclude long term sampling using techniques such as longlines for catch per unit effort, a key metric to assess patterns of relative abundance, diversity and the intraspecific demographics of sharks. Consequently, a relatively new technique that is particularly suited to rapid assessments has emerged that can further help to fill gaps in knowledge of species diversity and relative abundance. Baited remote underwater video set-­‐ups (BRUV) have been recently used to characterize predatory fish assemblages and the role of habitat structure on their abundances and diversity in a non-­‐invasive manner [1]. The Swan Islands, a remote outcrop on the edge of the Cayman Trench located northeast of Honduras' Bay Islands may represent one of the last pristine coral reef sites in the Western Caribbean. Remotely situated far from the Honduran coast and benefiting from protective legislation since 1991 (Government of Honduras 3056-­‐ 91) and a constant terrestrial presence of the Honduran Navy, the islands are expected by scientists and conservationists to reveal positive site and species differences in fauna and flora compared to other protected and unprotected sites that are monitored throughout the Caribbean. The purpose of this study was to therefore to rapidly and non-­‐invasively assess the diversity and relative abundance of elasmobranchs at the Swan Islands, data that would contribute to their management and protection at that site. Methods Sampling took place over the course of three days following a day-­‐long set up and calibration of the BRUVs. Four units were constructed using precut PVC, wood, rope, lead weights and zinc. Cameras used were GoPro Naked cameras (GoPro, Colorado, USA) with flatport housing and red corrective filters. Bait arms consisted of two empty beer cans filled with {\~{}}300g of little tunny (Euthynnus alleteratus) and lionfish (Pterois volitans) secured to the arm using chicken wire and plastic covered wire. The four BRUV units were deployed at 16 stations throughout the Swan Islands. Sampling took place on both the north or leeward side and south or windward side of Great and Little Swan Islands as well as near the channel bisecting the two islands. Each paired deployments represented two stations and two depth regimens. Depths roughly coincided with shallow (10m-­‐14m) and deeper (18m-­‐25m) bathymetric contours and represented the same mixed patch reef, and seagrass habitat throughout. Efforts were made to replicate the stations as many times as 3 possible during the field trip, with up to four replicates for specific stations. Each unit was lowered to the seabed off the back deck of the boat and guided into place by a snorkeler. A GPS mark was taken and sampling of the water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen was taken throughout the island waters using a YSI environmental parameter sampling instrument (YSI, USA). Each deployment was run continuously for 60{\textless} minutes before the unit was lifted back on deck, the cameras removed and the data cards downloaded and batteries recharged. Video was processed with footage truncated to the first 60 minutes of the deployment. Sharks were recorded by species, sexed (where possible) and size estimates were derived when possible using the beer cans as scale. Catch per unit effort was derived as the number of sharks per hour.

abstract = {THE Southern Ocean is the only oceanic domain encircling the
globe. It contains the strong eastward flow of the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current, and is the unifying link for exchanges of
water masses at all depths between the world's major ocean
basins1. As these exchanges are an important control on mean
global climate, the Southern Ocean is expected to play an
important role in transmitting climate anomalies around the
globe. Interannual variability has been often observed at high
southern latitudes, and observations of sea-ice extent suggest
that such features propagate eastwards around the Southern
Ocean2,3. Here we use data from a variety of observational
techniques to identify significant interannual variations in the
atmospheric pressure at sea level, wind stress, sea surface
temperature and sea-ice extent over the Southern Ocean. These
anomalies propagate eastward with the circumpolar flow, with a
period of 4–5 years and taking 8–10 years to encircle the pole.
This system of coupled anomalies, which we call the Antarctic
Circumpolar Wave, is likely to play an important role in climate
regulation and dynamics both within and beyond the Southern
Ocean.},

demonstrating high mobility and indicating that there may be a
rapid exchange of individuals and species among algae. Gastropods

specific ``epiphyte fauna'' could be distinguished from a
``holdfast fauna'', and species associated with epiphytes were
significantly more abundant on the artificial substrata.
Colonisation was more rapid in summer than in late autumn, which
may be related to animal population density. The high dispersal
rate can facilitate the interaction with other communities and
with higher trophic levels in the kelp-forest food web.},

@article{Littler1980-ul,
abstract = {A synthetic ``functional form'' paradigm concerning
hypothetically important adaptive features of algal structure and
function was developed and tested by a costs/benefits strategic
approach. Successional manipulations were performed by disturbing
mature, environmentally constant intertidal communities; from the
array of colonizing macroalgae, Ulva sp. was chosen as an
opportunistic representative of pioneer seral stages, Egregia
menziesii and Gelidium purpurascens/robustum as intermediate to
late seral species, and Pelvetia fastigiata and Corallina
officinalis as characteristic of more mature climax communities.
The ranking from high to low primary producers (Ulva {\textgreater} Gelidium {\textgreater}
Egregia {\textgreater} Pelvetia {\textgreater} Corallina) indicates that selection in
fluctuating environments has favored opportunistic species having
high net productivity, while those species able to persist in
benign predictable habitats do so at the cost of lower
photosynthetic rates and presumably slower growth. The
kilocalories per ash-free gram dry weight from highest to lowest
species were Ulva (5.44), Gelidium (4.62), Pelvetia (4.17),
Egregia (4.10), and Corallina (3.86). With the exception of
Pelvetia, which occurs high in the intertidal, these calorific
values suggest that selection has tended to reduce nutritive
content in climax algal forms. The results for percent thallus
loss to urchin grazing over a 48 h period generally support the
hypothesis that selection has differentially favored the
evolution of antipredator defenses in environmentally constant
macrophyte communities; Ulva lost considerably more of its
blotted wet weight (43.1{\%}) compared to Pelvetia (36.2{\%}),
Gelidium (22.9{\%}), Egregia (22.6{\%}), and the late seral form
Corallina (19.6{\%}). Ulva contained the lowest percentage of
nonpigmented (structural) components (0.6{\%}), followed by
Gelidium (46.2{\%}), Pelvetia (57.3{\%}), Corallina (81.7{\%} CaCO3),
and Egregia 82.9{\%}) which indicates that selection in mature
communities has tended to increase allocation of materials to
nonpigmented supportive structure at the expense of
photosynthetic tissue. Later successional macroalgae showed
greater toughness as well as greater resistance to wave-shearing
forces than the opportunistic species, thus implicating selection
for persistence as opposed to rapid growth in climax communities.
Data on succession, productivity, and toughness indicate that E.
menziesii shifts from an opportunistic strategy during its
juvenile stages to a highly differentiated complex form able to
persist in mature successional stages. The co-occurrence of
different morphological phases of the same species (e.g.,
Scytosiphon lomentaria, hollow sheet; Petalonia fascia, sheet;
and their Ralfsia-like forms, crusts), along with information
contrasting productivity, palatability, and longevity between
Gigartina papillata and its crustose alternate Petrocelis
middendorffii, suggests that some algae have the capacity to
concurrently adopt strategies of both opportunistic and climax
algal forms.},

forces imposed by extreme water velocities. Nonetheless, they
seldom have a shape that appears streamlined and they are
constructed of weak, compliant materials. How do they survive?
The answer is complex, but a coherent story is beginning to
emerge. The combined effect of frond shape and material
properties ensures that algae are flexible. In small
individuals, flexibility allows the plant to reorient and
reconfigure in flow, thereby assuming a streamlined shape and
reducing the applied hydrodynamic force. In large individuals,
flexibility allows fronds to 'go with the flow', a strategy that
can at times allow the plant to avoid hydrodynamic forces but
may at other times impose inertial loads. Our understanding of
algal mechanics is such that we can begin to predict the
survivorship of algae as a function of size, spatial
distribution and wave climate.},

@article{Airoldi2008,
abstract = {Structurally complex habitats are becoming rarer across temperate marine environments; indeed the coastal and marine world is getting flatter. In some cases marine habitats are lost entirely (e.g., wetlands are filled), but in many cases the loss is a gradual transition from a more complex to a less complex habitat (i.e., a change from canopy-forming to turf forming algae). We explore the multiple ways habitat loss affects marine species diversity, and propose a conceptual model that identifies the main interactions and feedbacks between these processes. The loss of habitat structure generally leads to lower abundances (biomasses) and often to declines in species richness. There is often also a suite of colonizing species that prosper from these transitions. These sets of expanding species can amplify the changes to the system, cause variable effects on species richness and other components of diversity, feed back to affect the various components of habitat loss (e.g. maintain new environmental conditions) and prevent the recovery of the system. Less well studied are the effects on between-habitat ($\beta$) diversity and functional diversity. We argue that we need to understand these latter changes to better manage and conserve the structure and function of ecosystems and the diverse services that humans continue to expect from them. Calling for more of the approaches and thinking that John Gray championed we discuss how this work can focus efforts in research, conservation, restoration and management. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {There is ongoing global concern over unwanted regime shifts in marine systems. Shifts from diverse and productive algal-dominated ecosystems to less productive urchin and coralline- dominated temperate reefs are becoming increasingly common. Kelp forests found along South Africa's south-west coast between Cape Point and Cape Agulhas occur in a region of biogeographical overlap. They are commonly referred to as transition zone kelp forests and are dynamic ecosystems that are particularly susceptible to grazing influence from species such as sea urchins. This study (1) explores the uniformity of these transition zone kelp forests along the western side of False Bay, with a focus on macroalgae and urchins, (2) identifies a threshold in urchin density above which algal abundance declines and (3) seeks to identify relationships between attached and drift algal abundance. Twenty replicate quadrats were sampled in six kelp forests along the western side of False Bay. Within each quadrat, urchins (Parechinus angulosus) and kelps (Ecklonia maxima) were counted, percentage covers of various understorey algal species were recorded and drift algae were collected. Although there was significant variability in algal and urchin cover across the six sites, kelps generally increased from north to south, while urchins did the opposite. Urchins were negatively correlated with algal communities, and a localised threshold of 1.43kg/m2 (50 urchins/m2) was identified, above which attached kelp density failed to increase above 10/m2 and percentage cover of understorey algae usually remained below 20{\%}. Surprisingly, no relationship was discovered between abundance of drift kelp and attached kelp, understorey algae or urchin density. This result was likely distorted by the naturally turbulent conditions of South African waters. Results highlight the complexity of these cool-water environments. To better understand the role of urchins in this system, experimental research into the feeding behaviour and effect of P. angulosus on kelps and understorey seaweeds in the presence/absence of drift algae is advised},

abstract = {Abstract Macroalgal communities in Australia and around the
world store vast quantities of carbon in their living biomass,
but their prevalence of growing on hard substrata means that
they have limited capacity to act as long-term carbon sinks.
Unlike other coastal blue carbon habitats such as seagrasses,
saltmarshes and mangroves, they do not develop their own
organic-rich sediments, but may instead act as a rich carbon
source and make significant contributions in the form of
detritus to sedimentary habitats by acting as a ?carbon donor?
to ?receiver sites? where organic material accumulates. The
potential for storage of this donated carbon however, is
dependent on the decay rate during transport and the burial
efficiency at receiver sites. To better understand the potential
contribution of macroalgal communities to coastal blue carbon
budgets, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using

enable robust quantification of macroalgae in marine

abstract = {In the sublittoral kelp forests of New South Wales, dictyotalean turfing algae dominate the substratum in areas where kelp canopies have been removed by storms. The effects of the presence of these algae on the recruitment of kelp plants and the subsequent structure of the benthic community were determined. Areas of turfing algae in clearings were experimentally cleared of turf at a time of dense kelp settlement, and areas of the kelp canopy were also removed. These treatments were compared with unmanipulated areas of turf in clearings and areas under the kelp canopy. The number of kelp recruits in each replicate plot was recorded throughout time as were the abundances of most of the macroscopic and microscopic species living on the substratum. Kelp was found to recruit very quickly to areas of substratum which had the overlying kelp canopy removed, but few recruits appeared under the natural canopy, or in areas xvith turfing algae, or in clearings where turfing algae had been removed. The results showed that whilst the presence of a natural kelp canopy and/or turfing algae inhibited the recruitment of kelps, removal of turfing species from clearings did not facilitate kelp recruitment. This indicated that the presence of turf did not solely inhibit kelp recruitment, but some lingering influence of turf seems to affect the substratum in clearings such that kelp cannot recruit to such areas. Turfing species returned and dominated the substratum in clearings where turf had been removed. After an initial decline, encrusting species increased in abundances in clearings where kelp recruited as these recruits developed a canopy. Turf and encrusting species remained great in cover in the respective control treatments. The results are discussed in terms of alternate stable states within this community. Such concepts are concluded to be dependent upon the spatial and temporal scales of one's investigation.},

drift macrophytes at a subtidal rocky reef in south-western
Australia. In one experiment, we manipulated the density of H.
erythrogramma in fenced plots; in a second, we manipulated the

manipulation of H. erythrogramma density did not result in
changes in attached macroalgal biomass, but the treatment with
the highest density of sea urchins had a greater drift macrophyte
biomass. When H. erythrogramma was removed from unfenced plots, a
slightly higher macroalgal biomass was observed in the austral
summer, but this difference was not present a few months later.
However, the drift biomass was 4 times higher in plots where sea
urchins were not removed. The dominant macrophyte species in the
drift were scarce or absent from the assemblage growing attached
to the reef, suggesting that much of the drift originated
elsewhere, either in adjacent seagrass beds or on reefs hundreds

retention of drift kelp Ecklonia radiata by H. erythrogramma .

abstract = {Wave action on exposed rocky coasts can be severe, generating
large hydrodynamic forces that have been proposed to constrain
the size of intertidal animals and plants. In contrast, flows
subtidally are more benign, and organisms, particularly
seaweeds, may grow quite large. The large dimensions of these
flexible macroalgae allow them to move during much or most of a
passing wave cycle, reducing relative water velocities and
modifying the forces the plants must endure. The consequences of
such wave-induced motion are explored for the stipitate
understory kelps Eisenia arborea and Pterygophora californica
using a numerical model that approximates these seaweeds as
vertically oriented cantilever beams subjected to lateral
hydrodynamic forces acting at their stipe tips. Bending moments
and peak stresses induced in the stipes of these species during
the passage of waves are calculated as functions of plant size
and shape and of water depth and sea state. Model predictions
for a subset of conditions are validated against real-time
measurements of bending moments acting on a Pterygophora
individual in the field. The results suggest that the allometric
patterns of growth exhibited by Eisenia and Pterygophora can
greatly reduce the stresses generated in the stipes of these
plants relative to isometric growth. Low stipe stiffness acts as
a general, particularly effective, stress-lowering mechanism.
The dynamic swaying associated with this low stiffness can also
modulate the magnitudes of peak stresses induced in the stipes
of these kelps. In particular, in shallow water under large
waves, dynamic loading can substantially increase induced
stress, suggesting that plant motion is an important factor
affecting the loading regime encountered by these organisms.},

Bathymetric profiles of density showed a strong qualitative and quantitative variation among sites, contrasting with the high evenness in spatial distribution of plants per depth interval, despite intervals of varying length. Relationships among morphometric parameters changed markedly across spatial scales, producing a high variance in biomass predictions. In most cases, strong site- and zone-specific components were identified, which account for the variability in morphology at both spatial scales. Zone effects may mirror water motion and temperature regimes, among other factors, and site effects may be related to specific habitat configurations. These results show that extrapolation from structural features of single stands for characterizing species may result in misleading inferences. The detection of scale-dependent patterns proved to be a useful starting point for comparative studies of population structure, and necessary before attempting generalizations.},

in approximately one third of the open ocean, with major
implications for carbon dioxide sequestration and carbon (C)
biogeochemistry. To date, understanding how alteration of Fe
supply changes phytoplankton physiology has focused on
traditional metrics such as growth rate, elemental composition,
and biophysical measurements such as photosynthetic competence
(Fv/Fm). Researchers have subsequently employed transcriptomics
to probe relationships between changes in Fe supply and
phytoplankton physiology. Recently, studies have investigated
longer-term (i.e. following acclimation) responses of
phytoplankton to various Fe conditions. In the present study, the
coastal diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, was acclimated (10
generations) to either low or high Fe conditions, i.e.
Fe-limiting and Fe-replete. Quantitative proteomics and a newly
developed proteomic profiling technique that identifies low
abundance proteins were employed to examine the full complement
of expressed proteins and consequently the metabolic pathways
utilized by the diatom under the two Fe conditions. A total of
1850 proteins were confidently identified, nearly tripling
previous identifications made from differential expression in
diatoms. Given sufficient time to acclimate to Fe limitation, T.
pseudonana up-regulates proteins involved in pathways associated
with intracellular protein recycling, thereby decreasing
dependence on extracellular nitrogen (N), C and Fe. The relative
increase in the abundance of photorespiration and pentose
phosphate pathway proteins reveal novel metabolic shifts, which
create substrates that could support other well-established
physiological responses, such as heavily silicified frustules
observed for Fe-limited diatoms. Here, we discovered that
proteins and hence pathways observed to be down-regulated in
short-term Fe starvation studies are constitutively expressed
when T. pseudonana is acclimated (i.e., nitrate and nitrite
transporters, Photosystem II and Photosystem I complexes).
Acclimation of the diatom to the desired Fe conditions and the
comprehensive proteomic approach provides a more robust
interpretation of this dynamic proteome than previous studies.},

abstract = {The IPCC AR5 provided an overview of the likely effects of climate change on Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS), stimulating increased interest in research examining the issue. We use these recent studies to develop a new synthesis describing climate change impacts on EBUS. We find that model and observational data suggest coastal upwelling-favorable winds in poleward portions of EBUS have intensified and will continue to do so in the future. Although evidence is weak in data that are presently available, future projections show that this pattern might be driven by changes in the positioning of the oceanic high-pressure systems rather than by deepening of the continental low-pressure systems, as previously proposed. There is low confidence regarding the future effects of climate change on coastal temperatures and biogeochemistry due to uncertainty in the countervailing responses to increasing upwelling and coastal warming, the latter of which could increase thermal stratification and render upwelling less effective in lifting nutrient-rich deep waters into the photic zone. Although predictions of ecosystem responses are uncertain, EBUS experience considerable natural variability and may be inherently resilient. However, multi-trophic level, end-to-end (i.e., "winds to whales") studies are needed to resolve the resilience of EBUS to climate change, especially their response to long-term trends or extremes that exceed pre-industrial ranges.},

up to 0.5 °C per decade in the southern Benguela from January to
August, and a cooling trend of lesser magnitude along the South

south-easterly and easterly winds. There is a positive trend in
SST of up to 0.55 °C per decade in most parts of the Agulhas

attributed to an intensification of the Agulhas Current in

abstract = {Coral reefs face a diverse array of threats, from eutrophication
and overfishing to climate change. As live corals are lost and
their skeletons eroded, the structural complexity of reefs
declines. This may have important consequences for the survival
and growth of reef fish because complex habitats mediate
predator-prey interactions [1, 2] and influence competition
[3-5] through the provision of prey refugia. A positive
correlation exists between structural complexity and reef fish
abundance and diversity in both temperate and tropical
ecosystems [6-10]. However, it is not clear how the diversity of
available refugia interacts with individual predator-prey
relationships to explain emergent properties at the community
scale. Furthermore, we do not yet have the ability to predict
how habitat loss might affect the productivity of whole reef
communities and the fisheries they support. Using data from an
unfished reserve in The Bahamas, we find that structural
complexity is associated not only with increased fish biomass
and abundance, but also with nonlinearities in the size spectra
of fish, implying disproportionately high abundances of certain
size classes. By developing a size spectrum food web model that
links the vulnerability of prey to predation with the structural
complexity of a reef, we show that these nonlinearities can be
explained by size-structured prey refugia that reduce mortality
rates and alter growth rates in different parts of the size
spectrum. Fitting the model with data from a structurally
complex habitat, we predict that a loss of complexity could
cause more than a 3-fold reduction in fishery productivity.},

abstract = {AbstractOf all the major coastal upwelling systems in the
world?s oceans, the Benguela, located off southwest Africa, is
the one that climate models find hardest to simulate well. This
paper investigates the sensitivity of upwelling processes, and
of sea surface temperature (SST), in this region to resolution
of the climate model and to the offshore wind structure. The
Community Climate System Model (version 4) is used here,
together with the Regional Ocean Modeling System. The main
result is that a realistic wind stress curl at the eastern
boundary, and a high-resolution ocean model, are required to
well simulate the Benguela upwelling system. When the wind
stress curl is too broad (as with a 1° atmosphere model or
coarser), a Sverdrup balance prevails at the eastern boundary,
implying southward ocean transport extending as far as 30°S and
warm advection. Higher atmosphere resolution, up to 0.5°, does
bring the atmospheric jet closer to the coast, but there can be
too strong a wind stress curl. The most realistic representation
of the upwelling system is found by adjusting the 0.5°
atmosphere model wind structure near the coast toward
observations, while using an eddy-resolving ocean model. A
similar adjustment applied to a 1° ocean model did not show such
improvement. Finally, the remote equatorial Atlantic response to
restoring SST in a broad region offshore of Benguela is
substantial; however, there is not a large response to
correcting SST in the narrow coastal upwelling zone alone.},

resolved frequencies up to 15 cph for a period of 33 days in

essentially uncorrelated at all depths. Longshore currents
exhibit significant coherence with the surface tide but not at

southerly wind lasting over 3 days was evident as a northbound
current that was most intense near the surface. The spectrum of
onshore currents exhibits a peak at the semidiurnal frequency
corresponding to internal tides, and there is a second lower,
but broader, peak at frequencies between 1 cph and the buoyancy
frequency. Onshore current amplitudes corresponding to the
internal tides are on the order of 20 cm s−1, while the higher
frequency fluctuations have amplitudes on the order of 3 cm s−1.
There is significant coherence between all measurements of
onshore current with a phase shift of $\pi$ between surface and
bottom currents. The onshore current measurements are consistent
with the mode 1 oscillations of a three-layer model consisting
of homogeneous surface and bottom layers separated by a layer

Unfortunately, a lack of standardized bioassay protocols has
limited the extent to which macroalgae have been used in routine
toxicity testing. In the present study, the effect of selected
reference toxicants (hexavalent chromium, copper and zinc) upon
germination and growth of zoospores of the marine macroalga
Ecklonia radiata (C.Ag.) J.Ag. was investigated in 48 h
bioassays. E. radiata is often a dominant member of near-shore
subtidal communi- ties in temperate Australia, New Zealand and
South Africa, regions m which toxicological data for native
species are lacking. Release of zoospores was induced in the
laboratory and settled spores were exposed to the metals.
Zoospores from 3 different populations in Western Australia and 1
population in Victoria were tested to evaluate geographic
variation in response. There were no significant ddfer- ences in
48 h EC,, values between the populations tested. At 20C, EC,,
values for germination ranged between 54.9 and 65.1 mg 1-' for

in 2 bioassays conducted with zinc. Germination of control
zoospores was greater than 90{\%} in all bioassays. Germination
tube growth was the more sensitive of the 2 endpoints examined.
ECS0 values for growth ranged between 31.8 and 47.5 mg I-' for
chromium and 180 and 210 pg 1-' for copper. Coefficients of
variation for ECS0 values from tests with chromium or copper were
between 24 and 47{\%} for germination and 11 and 54 {\%} for

well as the cycling of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen in interaction
with sediment and hydrodynamics. The integrated model is forced
by exchanges with the Atlantic Ocean (tide), atmosphere, and by
sediment and nutrient inputs from the upstream rivers and other
discharges. Focus is given to the light parameterization of
primary production, influence of hydro and sediment dynamics and
to the prediction of seaweed beds distribution. The results
obtained show that the model is better adjusted to field data

abstract = {Aim To assess environmental changes within a marine biogeographical transition zone and how they have affected seaweed assemblages and distributions over the past two decades. Location Brittany (western France, Europe) – a biogeographical transition zone between cold-temperate and warm-temperate regions. Methods We assessed spatio-temporal variation for three environmental parameters [sea-surface temperature (SST), suspended inorganic matter and chlorophyll a] between 1992 and 2012 in five adjoining regions using generalized linear models. To investigate changes in assemblages and distributional patterns of red seaweeds based on sampling surveys conducted during two separate periods (1992–1998 and 2010–2012), we used two complementary approaches, multivariate data analysis and species distribution models (SDMs) with a set of modelling procedures. Results Coastal water temperature in Brittany has increased by 0.7 °C on average over the past two decades (0.35 °C per decade). At a finer scale, changes in SST showed that Brittany constitutes a mosaic of contrasting conditions, with the western and north-western regions being colder and less affected by climate change than the other three regions. Our results suggest that increasing SST caused significant changes in subtidal red seaweed assemblages over the 20-year period. Between the two periods, SDMs predicted significant species shifts for seven out of ten representative species, and reductions in the distribution ranges of most species. Main conclusions Our study confirmed important differences across the different regions of the studied biogeographical transition zone. Changes in abiotic parameters and red seaweed assemblages are expected to occur at varying extremes across these regions, with western and north-western Brittany representing the most stable zones that might constitute a potential refuge for certain species when responding to global changes.},

We quantified the percentage cover of 4 morphological groups of benthic algae (encrusting and articu- lated coralline algae, and foliose and turfing algae) under canopies of kelp Ecklonia radiata and in areas without kelp (macroalgae {\textgreater}4 cm high). This was repeated over 4 spatial scales ranging from quadrats (separated by 10s of m), sites (separated by km), locations (separated by 100s of km) to regions (separated by 1000s of km) across the southern coastline of Australia: Western Australia (WA), Southern Australia (SA) and Eastern Australia (EA). The key result was that while comparison among sites revealed substantial and often inconsistent variation in abundance of benthic algae between habitats (kelp vs open), clear patterns emerged when locations and regions were compared. In EA, where grazers are effective in maintaining extensive areas of encrusting corallines, patterns of algal cover between habitats (kelp vs open) were generally reversed to WA and SA, where grazers are sub- stantially less effective. These results indicate a large distinction in the ecology of these regions (WA = SA ≠ EA) and how lack of understanding of this pattern at the regional scale tends to suggest overwhelming variation when single studies are compared among regions. These differences also highlight that comparisons of studies done at small scales, even if done at several sites in a locality, provide a difficult basis to understand the generality of pattern in algal assemblage structure due to large variation at this scale. While we acknowledge that these broad patterns were not possible to validate at the scale of sites, it was possible to increase the scale of observation to encompass broader patterns that might be organized around a relatively simple set of ecological predictions},

opportunistic (ESG II) species. The first group comprises species
with a thick or calcareous thallus, low growth rates and long

sheet-like and filamentous species with high growth rates and
short life cycles (annuals). Seagrasses were included in the
first group, whereas Cyanophyceae and species with a coarsely
branched thallus were included in the second group. The
evaluation of ecological status into five categories from high to
bad includes a cross comparison in a matrix of the ESGs and a
numerical scoring system (Ecological Evaluation Index). The model
could allow comparisons, ranking and setting of priorities at
regional and national levels fulfilling the requirements of the

Young kelp plants were more 13C depleted (–23.59‰). The red algae fell into 2 groups: one in the same range as kelp plants ($\delta$13C: –18.93 to –22.27‰) and the other highly depleted ($\delta$13C: –32.85 to –34.38‰). Phytoplankton showed an average $\delta$13C value of –24.44‰. $\delta$15N values from L. hyperborea differed between the basal ($\delta$15N: 5.54‰) and distal ($\delta$15N: 3.54‰) part of lamina. $\delta$15N values for all primary producers values were in the range of 3.52 to 5.78‰. Among the gastropods, Helcion pellucida proved to be a kelp plant grazer, Lacuna vincta probably fed on both kelp and various species of red algae, whereas Aplysia punctata grazed ex- clusively on the most 13C-depleted red algae. $\delta$15N values for 2 other gastropods, Gibbula sp. and Calliostoma zizyphinum (8.64 and 10.30‰, respectively), suggest that they belong to higher trophic levels. Filter feeders occupied lower trophic levels and received variable carbon inputs from kelp. The only group of animals with $\delta$13C signals in the same range as phytoplankton were amphipods. Based on $\delta$15N values, the fish varied from intermediate to top consumers (trophic level: 2.6 to 3.3). Two species of seabirds were included in the study and their $\delta$15N values suggested 2 different trophic levels, which correspond to their known feeding preferences.

The relationships between LOI at 550 degreesC (LOI550) and organic carbon (OC) content and between LOI at 950 degreesC (LOI950) and inorganic carbon (IC) content are currently accepted as a standard. However, the comparison of 150 analyses of samples of diverse lithologies, collected from a single core, reveals that these relationships are affected by sediment composition (presence of clays, salts, and the variable content of organic carbon). This results in an incremental error on the estimation of carbon content from LOI values that invalidates the use of LOI values as a quantitative method for estimating carbon content. Conversely, the general trends of LOI550 and LOI950 show a good correlation with carbon content (both organic and inorganic) allowing use of LOI as a qualitative test for carbon content. Similarly, in our case, LOI at 105degreesC (LOI105) is a good qualitative proxy for the trends in gypsum content.},

Sponges were identified and classified within the following
morphological groups: encrusting, massive, globular, pedunculate,
tubular, flabellate, arborescent, repent and papillate
morphological types on both vertical (approximate to 90 degrees)
and inclined (approximate to 45 degrees) surfaces. Differences in
the proportional abundance of the sponge body forms and density
(sponge m(-2)) were observed between sites and depths. The
density of sponges increased with depth at sites of slight to
moderate current flow, but not at the site where current flow was
turbulent. Morphological diversity of sponge communities
decreased with increasing current flow due to the removal of
delicate forms such as pedunculate and arborescent shaped
sponges. Massive and encrusting morphologies dominated at the
high-energy sites (fast and turbulent flow regimes) due to a high
basal area to volume ratio, which prevents removal from cliff
surfaces. However, pedunculate, papillate and arborescent types
dominated at the low current sites as these shapes may help to
prevent the settlement of sediment on sponge surfaces.

formidable endeavor. Zooplankton face challenges related to
global warming, ocean acidification, the proliferation of toxic

hypoxia. They can respond to these changes by phenotypic
plasticity or genetic adaptation. Using the concept of the
evolution of reaction norms, I address how adaptive responses can
be unequivocally discerned from phenotypic plasticity. To date,
relatively few zooplankton studies have been designed for such a
purpose. As case studies, I review the evidence for zooplankton
adaptation to toxic algal blooms, hypoxia, and climate change.
Predicting the response of zooplankton to global change requires
new information to determine (a) the trade-offs and costs of
adaptation, (b) the rates of evolution versus environmental
change, (c) the consequences of adaptation to stochastic or
cyclic (toxic algal blooms, coastal hypoxia) versus directional
(temperature, acidification, open ocean hypoxia) environmental
change, and (d) the interaction of selective pressures, and

abstract = {The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is one of the largest and
fastest growing seaweeds and is dominant over large areas of the
west coast of North America. A model of its growth has been
developed which describes plant biomass and production over the
course of a year as a function of environmental parameters which
affect the light flux. Such parameters include water clarity,
spacing between plants, bottom depth, latitude, harvesting
activity, and photosynthetic response (Pmax and Ik). Model
results for a standard set of conditions (latitude 33°N, 3 m
plant spacing, water absorbance of 0.115 m-1 and 12 m depth)
yield a peak daily gross production of almost 6 g C m-2 d-1,
peak daily net production of almost 3 g C m-2 d-1, and a peak
specific growth rate of about 0.022 d-1. Annual gross production
for this case is 1 567 g C m-2 yr-1; annual net production is
537 g C m-2 yr-1. These values are comparable to those from
field measurements. Size and timing of biomass and production
peaks are affected by changes in the parameters describing the
light field, with peaks usually occurring later in the year for
more adverse circumstances. Inhigher latitudes, the seasonal
variation is so extreme that the plant could not last the year
at 53° N in 12 m of water, although it is able to survive the
year in shallower water. Harvesting has severe effects on
biomass and production. Model results suggest that light
limitation is a very important constraint on kelp growth that
should not be overlooked. This implies that differences in
parameters describing two environments must be considered when
comparing results obtained at different locales.},

abstract = {Predicting consequences of ocean deoxygenation and ocean
acidification for nearshore marine ecosystems requires baseline
dissolved oxygen (DO) and carbonate chemistry data that are both
high-frequency and high-quality. Such data allow accurate
assessment of environmental variability and present-day organism
exposure regimes. In this study, scales of DO and pH variability
were characterized over one year in a nearshore kelp forest
ecosystem in the Southern California Bight. DO and pH were
strongly, positively correlated, revealing that organisms on this
upwelling shelf are not only exposed to low pH but also to low
DO. The dominant scale of temporal DO and pH variability occurred
on semidiurnal, diurnal and event (days–weeks) time scales. Daily
ranges in DO and pH at 7 m water depth (13 mab) could be as large
as 220 $\mu$mol kg−1 and 0.36 units, respectively. Sources of pH and
DO variation include photosynthesis within the kelp forest
ecosystem, which can elevate DO and pH by up to 60 $\mu$mol kg−1 and
0.1 units over one week following the intrusion of high-density,
nutrient-rich water. Accordingly, highly productive
macrophyte-based ecosystems could serve as deoxygenation and
acidification refugia by acting to elevate DO and pH relative to
surrounding waters. DO and pH exhibited greater spatial variation
over a 10 m increase in water depth (from 7 to 17 m) than along a
5 km stretch of shelf in a cross-shore or alongshore direction.
Over a three-month time period, mean DO and pH at 17 m water
depth were 168 $\mu$mol kg−1 and 7.87, respectively. These values
represent a 35{\%} decrease in mean DO and 37{\%} increase in [H+]
relative to near-surface waters. High-frequency variation was
also reduced at depth. The mean daily range in DO and pH was 39{\%}
and 37{\%} less, respectively, at 17 m water depth relative to 7 m.
As a consequence, the exposure history of an organism is largely
a function of its depth of occurrence within the kelp forest.
With knowledge of local alkalinity conditions and high-frequency
temperature, salinity, and pH data, we estimated pCO2 and calcium
carbonate saturation states with respect to calcite and aragonite
($\Omega$calc and $\Omega$arag) for the La Jolla kelp forest at 7 m and 17 m
water depth. pCO2 ranged from 246 to 1016 $\mu$atm, $\Omega$calc was always
supersaturated, and $\Omega$arag was undersaturated at the beginning of
March for five days when pH was less than 7.75 and DO was less
than 115 $\mu$mol kg−1. These findings raise the possibility that the
benthic communities along eastern boundary current systems are
currently acclimatized and adapted to natural, variable, and low
DO and pH. Still, future exposure of coastal California
populations to even lower DO and pH may increase as upwelling
intensifies and hypoxic boundaries shoal, compressing habitats
and challenging the physiological capacity of intolerant species.},

We examined spatial (metre to kilometre scales) and temporal (weekly to yearly scales) patterns in abundance of settlers of the introduced bryozoan Membranipora membranacea on the numerically dominant kelp Saccharina longicruris, at 2 sites in St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada. Relation- ships between patterns in settlement and indices of the temperature regime, such as average weekly temperature, temperature fluctuations, water column stratification and thermal history (growing degree-day) were determined using multiple linear regressions. Although settler abundance varied interannually, it was highest in early autumn, and was generally higher at depth (12 and 8 m) than in the shallows (4 m). Abundance was an order of magnitude greater after a significantly warmer win- ter. Growing degree-day accounted for up to 81{\%} of the variability in settler abundance, whereas average temperature, temperature fluctuations and stratification were less important. The strong positive relationship between thermal history and settlement of this ecologically important species suggests that abundance of established introduced marine species may increase with the increased temperatures predicted to result from climate change},

@article{Dayton1984,
abstract = {This paper considers three concepts of stability as they relate to the dynamics of dis- tinctive patch types of algal canopy guilds in southern and central California kelp communities: (1) persistence of a patch through more than one generation of the dominant species, which was evaluated by using life tables and observations of patch borders; (2) inertia or the resistance of different patches to invasion or disturbance, which was evaluated by artificially enhancing gametophytes by transplanting sporogenic material, by removing canopy, and by evaluating some important disturbance processes; and (3) resilience or recoverability of a patch following a perturbation sufficient to allow invasion of different species, which was studied by defining some of the mechanisms of successful invasion or succession. By working in distinct habitats in southern (Pt. Loma and Santa Catalina Island) and central (Pt. Piedras Blancas) California, we could evaluate different types of physical stresses as they related to these stability concepts. Taller perennial canopy guilds were dominant competitors for light, but were more susceptible to physical wave stress. Dominance hierarchies in the competition for light appeared to be reversed in areas exposed to increasing wave stress. The main causes of mortality at Pt. Loma were entanglement with storm-dislodged Macrocystis plants and, in some areas, sea urchin grazing. Mortality in central California was due to winter storms. In most cases, distinct patches resisted invasion for {\textgreater} 10 yr. The mechanisms of resistance involved (1) competition for light and, possibly, nutrients, and (2) limits to spore dispersal. When succession occurred, it was often mediated by many factors, including seasonality of spore production, which coincided with winter storm-related mortalities; mechanisms of kelp dispersal, which were most effective via drifting plants and fragments of fertile material held against the substrate by invertebrates; and survivorship of gametophytes and small sporophytes, which was influenced by local scour and grazing. Appropriate spatial scales, stability, and succession studies in these kelp communities were determined by the size of the disturbed area, which varied from the free space resulting from detachment of single plants to the free space resulting from catastrophies such as overgrazing or unusual storms. Temporal scales were influenced by seasonality of disturbance and algal reproductive condition and aperiodic episodes of cool, nutrient-rich water advected into the patch. There appeared to be conflicting morphological adaptations of the canopy guilds: exploitation of light was enhanced at higher canopy levels, whereas the lower canopy levels were better adapted to tolerate stress from wave surge. The adaptations of the algae appeared to form four distinct groups of tactics: (1) ruderals or plants, such as Nereocystis and Desmarestia, with opportunistic life histories; (2) kelps, such as Macrocystis, adapted to exploitative competition for light and nutrients; (3) kelps (Eisenia, Dictyoneurum) adapted to physical stress such as wave surge; and (4) those algae, such as corallines and Agarum, adapted to heavy grazing. Within any given area, the relative patch stability was determined by biological relationships; between areas, the patch stability patterns were attributable to physical differences.},

abstract = {The causes of spatial variation in the recruitment of benthic marine algae are frequently misunderstood because of difficulties in distinguishing among the many factors that influence the supply and establishment of microscopic propagules. We used the recently constructed San Clemente Artificial Reef (SCAR) experiment to examine the roles of dispersal distance, size of spore source, and habitat availability as sources of variation in the recruitment of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Ag., a species whose recruitment has often been considered to be dispersal limited. Sparse colonization on SCAR by adult Macrocystis occurred within 6 months after reef construction via drifters (i.e. individuals from neighboring kelp beds that became dislodged and set adrift). The abundance of drifters on SCAR declined exponentially with distance from the nearest source population (San Mateo), suggesting that San Mateo was the likely source of drifters. Dense recruitment of small Macrocystis sporophytes was observed within 8 months of reef construction. The density of recruits on SCAR showed an initial increase with distance from San Mateo before declining exponentially. Nonetheless, substantial recruitment was observed at the most distant locations on SCAR located 3.5 km from San Mateo. In contrast to drifters, the density of recruits was positively correlated to the bottom cover of artificial reef substrate. Importantly, no correlation was found between the local density or fecundity of drifters and the local density of kelp recruits suggesting that recruitment on SCAR resulted from widespread spore dispersal rather than from the local dispersal of spores from drifters.},

abstract = {Interactions between water motion, primary productivity, and herbivory are complex. Rates of grazing by fish on tropical coral reefs and by sea urchins on temperate rocky reefs are usually high, but can be low in areas of extreme water motion. Some herbivores can switch between mobile (grazing) and sedentary (drift-feeding) behaviours, and this can be influenced by water motion. We compared the relative consumption of the kelp Ecklonia radiata at rocky reefs in western Australia with different wave exposures (inshore versus offshore). No herbivory was recorded offshore, suggesting that wave exposure might inhibit herbivory, We also compared grazing by fish and sea urchins, and grazing versus drift-feeding pathways. Grazing by fish and sea urchins was low, except at one inshore reef where grazing by fish was intense. In contrast, drift-feeding by sea urchins was recorded at all inshore reefs, suggesting that this is a ubiquitous behaviour in the region. We measured productivity of E. radiata to determine if spatial patterns in rates of herbivory matched those of productivity. Productivity of E. radiata was higher on offshore reefs at one location. The observed difference in consumption between inshore and offshore reefs at both locations suggests that consumption is not limited by productivity, but by exposure. Further, the high productivity offshore combined with low rates of herbivory suggest that offshore reefs might be a source of kelp that subsidises other habitats.},

within the range of speeds determined from observation, though an
admixture of a mode 2 CTW is possible. It is found that the
speeds of wind systems moving along the coast also fall in the

abstract = {Wave exposure is one of the main structuring forces in the
marine environment. Methods that enable large scale
quantification of environmental variables have become
increasingly important for predicting marine communities in the
context of spatial planning and coastal zone management.
Existing methods range from cartographic solutions to numerical
hydrodynamic simulations, and differ in the scale and spatial
coverage of their outputs. Using a biological exposure index we
compared the performance of four wave exposure models ranging
from simple to more advanced techniques. All models were found
to be related to the biological exposure index and their
performance, measured as bootstrapped R2distributions,
overlapped. Qualitatively, there were differences in the spatial
patterns indicating higher complexity with more advanced
techniques. In order to create complex spatial patterns wave
exposure models should include diffraction, especially in
coastal areas rich in islands. The inclusion of wind strength
and frequency, in addition to wind direction and bathymetry,
further tended to increase the amount of explained variation.
The large potential of high-resolution numerical models to
explain the observed patterns of species distribution in complex
coastal areas provide exciting opportunities for future
research. Easy access to relevant wave exposure models will aid
large scale habitat classification systems and the continuously
growing field of marine species distribution modelling,
ultimately serving marine spatial management and planning. {\textcopyright}

We used five common predators including four carnivores (crabs, shrimp, blennies and killifish) and one omnivore (pinfish). Three carnivorous predators each induced a strong trophic cascade by reducing herbivore abundance and increasing algal biomass and diversity. Surprisingly, increasing predator diversity reversed these effects on macroalgae and altered algal composition, largely due to the inclusion and performance of omnivorous fish in diverse predator assemblages. Changes in predator diversity can cascade to lower trophic levels; the exact effects, however, will be difficult to predict due to the many complex interactions that occur in diverse food webs.},

We examine biodiversity patterns associated with kelp holdfasts, stipes and blades, as well as the wider understorey habitat, and search for generality between kelp species and biogeographic regions.

abstract = {To develop a management strategy for informal fishers, a
necessary first step is information about the nature of these
fishers, their numbers and their socio-economic status. To
accomplish this, a survey of socio-economic conditions and use
of marine resources was undertaken in 1999 at 20 localities
where fishing occurs around the coast of South Africa,
concentrating on subsistence or small- to micro-scale artisanal
commercial fishers. In each locality, 16?31 ``fisher
households'' were surveyed by questionnaires, focus-group
discussions and interviews with key informants. Demographic
analyses revealed a low level of migrancy (?5{\%}), an average of
5.3 persons per household and a mean age of 27. Only ?20{\%} of
fishers were women and ?15{\%} were children. Poverty was
prevalent: unemployment averaged 40.3{\%} (much higher than the
national norm of 29.3{\%}). Mean adult equivalent income per month
spanned R193?R735 among regions, and was not correlated with
size of settlement. Education levels were low, only ?33{\%} of
people {\textgreater}20 years old having completed primary school. Migrancy
was highest in rural areas (but still much less than the
national norm), intermediate in towns and least in metropolitan
areas. Household size, participation of women and poverty all
followed similar trends. Comparing regions, the East Coast and
the province of KwaZulu-Natal had higher migrancy rates, larger
household sizes, greater poverty, and greater participation by
women in fishing, than on the South and West coasts. Household
expenditure on food was ?R450 per month on the South-East and
KwaZulu-Natal coasts and ?R750 on the West Coast, and exceeded
60{\%} of income (a measure of ``food security'') in about half
the households surveyed. Harvested resources were sold, consumed
or used as bait. In all regions, the two most frequently
harvested resources were fish (mostly sold, predominantly fished
by men) and intertidal rocky-shore invertebrates (largely
consumed, and involving women to a greater degree). On the West
Coast, rock lobster Jasus lalandii was the third-most important
resource, but on the South and KwaZulu-Natal coasts this species
was replaced by estuarine invertebrates. Abalone Haliotis midae,
oysters, sandy-beach invertebrates and kelp or seaweeds made up
the balance. Diversity of harvested resources increased west to
east, following biogeographic trends. The resources could be
divided into those of high value (rock lobsters, abalone and, to
a lesser extent, fish) and those of lower value (such as
limpets, mussels and bait organisms). It is argued that
high-value resources are best used to create micro- and
small-scale commercial enterprises that can serve to uplift poor
fishers. Low-value resources constitute subsistence resources,
for which preferential rights should be established for
subsistence fishers, including development of exclusive-use
zones where necessary. Emerging characteristics of fishing
communities that were helpful in defining subsistence fishers in
the South African context were poverty, harvest for self-use
(whether by consumption or sale to meet basic needs of food
security), use of low-technology gear, and concentration of
effort on or from shores or in estuaries. At least portions of
the catches of all resources are sold, and the majority of
equipment is purchased, so any definition of subsistence fishers
cannot exclude those who sell part of their catch or do not use
hand-made equipment. Some success was evident with
co-management, encouraging further exploration of this style of
management for subsistence fishers.},

mumol m-2 s-1) for the temperate marine macroalgae Chondrus
crispus, Fucus serratus, Petalonia fascia, Porphyra purpurea and
Ulva lactuca measured at 7-degrees-C. These I(c)-values
corresponded to those estimated by a physiological model
including light absorption and quantum yield for growth to
describe carbon gain, and weight specific dark respiration, dark
loss rate and thallus specific carbon (mol C m-2 thallus) to
describe carbon loss. Absorption and quantum yield were close to
the theoretical maximum for all species and could not explain
differences in I(c). Respiration and thallus specific carbon
varied more than 15-fold and were the main factors responsible
for variations in I(c). Experimental I(c)-values correspond to
0.12 to 0.61 {\%} of the yearly surface light dose in Denmark
(56-degrees-N). These values agree with the {\%} of surface light
({\%}SI) available at the depth limits of leathery and foliose
macroalgae at different latitudes. Hence, there is no surplus of
energy to balance grazing and mechanical losses, and these
factors must be of minor importance for macroalgae growing at
great depths. A literature review of depth limits for marine
macroalgae reveals an upper zone of mainly leathery algae with
depth limits of about 0.5 {\%} SI, an intermediate zone of foliose
and delicate algae with depth limits at about 0.10 {\%} SI, and a
lower zone of encrusted algae extending down to about 0.01 {\%} SI.
This zonation pattern is accompanied by a decrease in thallus
specific carbon (i.e. thinner thalli) with increasing depth. The
inverse relationship between growth rate at low light and thallus
specific carbon suggests that a thin thallus is essential for
growth and survival of marine macroalgae at great depths.},

abstract = {Macroalgal canopies modify their surrounding environment and thereby influence the structure of associated algal assemblages. Canopies can modify many factors that can be hard to separate and, consequently, the importance of individual factors often remains unknown. Experiments were carried out to test the hypotheses that Ecklonia radiata canopies modify light, sediment cover and water motion, and that each of these physical factors separately influence the assemblage of associated foliose algae. We measured light, sediment cover and water motion across six naturally occurring E. radiata densities and found a reduction in light and sediment cover as kelp density increased. The outcome for water motion was inconclusive. We also manipulated each of these three factors, while controlling for the two others, to determine the separate effects of light, sediment cover and water motion on the assemblage of foliose algae. Reduction in light had a strong effect on the foliose assemblage, reducing species richness and biomass. Reduction in sediment cover and water motion did not cause separate effects at the level of the assemblage, but the biomass of individual species of foliose algae indicated both positive and negative effects. We conclude that E. radiata canopies at Marmion, Western Australia, modify at least two factors of their physical environment, light and sediment cover. However, only light is modified to an extent where it has effects at the assemblage-level because, in contrast to the effects of sediment cover and water motion, the direction of responses are consistent among individual species of algae.},

Here, we synthesize information from {\textgreater}60 years of research on the structure and functioning of kelp forest habitats in European waters, with particular emphasis on the coasts of UK and Ireland, which represents an important biogeographic transition zone that is subjected to multiple threats and stressors. We collated existing data on kelp distribution and abundance and reanalyzed these data to describe the structure of kelp forests along a spatial gradient spanning more than 10° of latitude. We then examined ecological goods and services provided by kelp forests, including elevated secondary production, nutrient cycling, energy capture and flow, coastal defense, direct applications, and biodiversity repositories, before discussing current and future threats posed to kelp forests and identifying key knowledge gaps. Recent evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the structure of kelp forests in the NE Atlantic is changing in response to climate- and non-climate-related stressors, which will have major implications for the structure and functioning of coastal ecosystems. However, kelp-dominated habitats along much of the NE Atlantic coastline have been chronically understudied over recent decades in comparison with other regions such as Australasia and North America. The paucity of field-based research currently impedes our ability to conserve and manage these important ecosystems. Targeted observational and experimental research conducted over large spatial and temporal scales is urgently needed to address these knowledge gaps.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting and abating the loss of natural habitats
present a huge challenge in science, conservation and management.
Algal forests are globally threatened by loss and severe
recruitment failure, but our understanding of resilience in these
systems and its potential disruption by anthropogenic factors
lags well behind other habitats. We tested hypotheses regarding
triggers for decline and recovery potential in subtidal forests
of canopy-forming algae of the genus Cystoseira.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By using a combination of
historical data, and quantitative in situ observations of natural
recruitment patterns we suggest that recent declines of forests
along the coasts of the north Adriatic Sea were triggered by
increasing cumulative impacts of natural- and human-induced
habitat instability along with several extreme storm events.
Clearing and transplantation experiments subsequently
demonstrated that at such advanced stages of ecosystem
degradation, increased substratum stability would be essential
but not sufficient to reverse the loss, and that for recovery to
occur removal of the new dominant space occupiers (i.e.,
opportunistic species including turf algae and mussels) would be
required. Lack of surrounding adult canopies did not seem to
impair the potential for assisted recovery, suggesting that in
these systems recovery could be actively enhanced even following
severe depletions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that
sudden habitat loss can be facilitated by long term changes in
the biotic and abiotic conditions in the system, that erode the
ability of natural ecosystems to absorb and recover from multiple
stressors of natural and human origin. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the mere restoration of environmental conditions preceding a
loss, if possible, may be insufficient for ecosystem restoration,
and is scarcely cost-effective. We conclude that the loss of
complex marine habitats in human-dominated landscapes could be
mitigated with appropriate consideration and management of
incremental habitat changes and of attributes facilitating system
recovery.},

abstract = {The natural diet and mode of feeding of the rock lobster J. lalandii (H. Milne Edwards) was determined in a rock-lobster sanctuary near Cape Town, South Africa. Field observations were tested and confirmed by means of aquarium studies. Rock lobsters feed mainly upon ribbed mussels A. ater (Molina), which comprise the largest component of the sessile benthic fauna. Mussel remains were found as the major constituent in 97{\%} of the rock-lobster stomachs examined. The density of rock lobsters averaged 8100/ha (0.81 m-2), while mussel biomass averaged more than 5 kg (wet whole weight) m-2 within the same depth range (12-30 m). More than 80{\%} of the mussel biomass comprised large individuals between 60 and 90 mm in length. Large rock lobsters (mainly males) were capable of feeding on all sizes of mussels, although many of these were inaccessible to predation. Smaller rock lobsters became progressively more limited in the size range of mussels which they could crack open and consume. Competition between rock lobsters for small mussels appeared to be intense, as mussels of suitable size for feeding were generally in short supply to most of the rock-lobster population. Feeding and growth rates of rock lobsters are likely to be affected by the relative population densities of predator and prey. Growth rates of rock lobsters could be limited by food supplies even in areas where mussel biomass is comparatively large.},

abstract = {Drifting rafts of Macrocystis pyrifera may connect isolated kelp forests in the Southern California Bight. To determine which species might utilize this dispersal mechanism, faunal samples from natural drifting rafts and attached M. pyrifera plants were collected during five cruises between March 1995 and December 1997. These rafts, which can be considered as floating islands, were aged and the macroinvertebrate assemblage enumerated. There was no significant relationship between raft age and species richness, or between species richness and distance offshore, which contrasts with predictions based on island biogeography. Species richness, however, was related to raft weight. Patterns of species presence and density were investigated relative to raft age for the species most frequently associated with rafts. Only one species, the isopod Idotea resecata, was found on all sampled rafts. Some species increased in frequency with raft age and others decreased, but only one relationship, a decline in the frequency of the anemone Epiactis prolifera with raft age was significant. When species density was examined over all cruises, only I. resecata had a significant change in density (an increase) with raft age, but additional significant relationships were found when species density patterns were considered by cruise. The results of all the tests were combined to provide a measure of 'raft success'. Nine of the most frequent 19 species had a positive score, indicating a favorable response to rafting, seven were unaffected, and two species had negative responses to rafting. Extinction times were calculated using species abundance and raft age relationships. Two species (E. prolifera and Paracerceis cordata), were predicted to persist on rafts for only about 100 days, which is the maximum estimated raft lifetime. All other species were predicted to persist for longer periods if the rafts floated longer. Kelp fauna that begin rafting appear to be largely unaffected by rafting, and hence dispersal on kelp rafts is possible for many members of the kelp forest community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Above the temperature optima, continued cultivation under high temperature had a negative impact on the recovery of photoinhibition. The higher capacity for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in A. esculenta and L. digitata helped to regulate and protect photosynthesis under light and temperature stress compared to S. latissima.

evolutionary adaptation to temperature at the molecular level
for some cellular processes, we still know little about
evolutionary temperature adaptation in gene expression,
cell-cycle control or growth, all of which influence organism
performance and fitness. Recent studies have shown that the
physiological costs of evolutionary temperature adaptation vary
with body temperature. Here, I argue that this macroecological
pattern has powerful consequences for life-history theory, and
probably also for food-web dynamics, biological diversity and
biotic response to climate change. The relationships among
evolution, temperature and ecology are multivariate,
hierarchical and complex making evolutionary physiology at the
macroecological scale an exciting and challenging agenda for the
next decade.},

abstract = {Macroalgal mats of Ulva intestinalis are becoming increasingly
common in many coastal and estuarine intertidal habitats, thus
it is important to determine whether they increase flow
resistance, promote bed stability and therefore reduce the risk
of erosion favoring tidal flooding or degradation of coastal
lagoons. Venier et al. (2012) [6] studied the impact of
macroalgal mats of Ulva intestinalis on flow dynamics and
sediment stability for uniform flow. Here we extend their
experimental work to the case of vegetation under the combined
action of waves and currents. These hydrodynamic conditions are
very common in many shallow coastal environments and lagoons.
The experimental facility employed in the present study and the
series of flow runs are the same as that used by Venier et al.
(2012)[6]. However, waves have been superposed to uniform
current flowing firstly over a mobile sediment bed covered with
U. intestinalis, then over a bare sediment surface. For the
depth, wave and current conditions considered in the
experiments, the time-averaged vertical profile of horizontal
velocity for the case of coexisting waves and current turns out
to be very close to that observed for a pure current, both with
and without vegetation. However, contrary to what was observed
in the case of a unidirectional current, in the presence of
waves the time averaged velocity profile is only weakly
influenced by the vegetation, whose main effect is to attenuate
velocity oscillations induced by waves and to slightly increase
the overall bed roughness.},

production drive secondary production in many ecosystems, often
sustaining diversity and overall productivity. Despite their
importance in structuring marine communities, there is little
understanding of how subsidies move through juxtaposed habitats
and into recipient communities. We investigated the transport of
detritus from kelp forests to a deep Arctic fjord (northern
Norway). We quantified the seasonal abundance and size structure
of kelp detritus in shallow subtidal (0-12 m), deep subtidal
(12-85 m), and deep fjord (400-450 m) habitats using a
combination of camera surveys, dive observations, and detritus
collections over 1 year. Detritus formed dense accumulations in
habitats adjacent to kelp forests, and the timing of depositions
coincided with the discrete loss of whole kelp blades during
spring. We tracked these blades through the deep subtidal and
into the deep fjord, and showed they act as a short-term
resource pulse transported over several weeks. In deep subtidal
regions, detritus consisted mostly of fragments and its depth
distribution was similar across seasons (50{\%} of total
observations). Tagged pieces of detritus moved slowly out of
kelp forests (displaced 4-50 m (mean 11.8 m ± 8.5 SD) in 11-17
days, based on minimum estimates from recovered pieces), and
most (75{\%}) variability in the rate of export was related to
wave exposure and substrate. Tight resource coupling between
kelp forests and deep fjords indicate that changes in kelp
abundance would propagate through to deep fjord ecosystems, with
likely consequences for the ecosystem functioning and services
they provide.},

The contribution of the West Coast region to total lobster landings declined from about 60{\%} to {\textless}10{\%}, whereas in the southern region it increased from around 18{\%} to 60{\%} during that period. The early 1990s was also the start of a major influx of lobsters into the area east of Cape Hangklip, an area not previously associated with high lobster abundance. Whereas the 1990s was a period of change, the period 2000 to present has been one of relative stability in lobster catches. The ecological, fisheries and resource management implications of these shifts have been severe and are likely to cause challenges in the future management of both the rock lobster and abalone Haliotes midae resources. The temporal coincidence of the shifts in lobster distribution with events such as the onset of reduced somatic growth and increased lobster walkouts suggests environmental forcing factors, as do congruent changes in other components of South Africa's Western Cape marine ecosystems. However, despite a number of studies on the variability of the physical environment, the causes of these events remain poorly understood.},

Waves associated with winter storms were consistently higher in central California, and the loss of kelp biomass to winter wave disturbance was on average twice that of southern California. These observations that the more intense wave disturbance in central suggest California limited NPP by giant kelp under otherwise favorable conditions. Regional patterns of interannual variation in NPP were similar to those of wave disturbance in that year-to-year variation in disturbance and NPP were both greater in southern California. Our findings strong evidence that regional differences in wave disturbance overwhelmed those of provide nutrient supply and grazing intensity to determine NPP by giant kelp. The important role of disturbance in controlling NPP revealed by our study is likely not unique to giant kelp forests, as vegetation in many systems are dominated succession with dynamics by post-disturbance climax communities being relatively uncommon. The effects of disturbance frequency may be easier to detect in giant kelp because it is fast growing and relatively short lived, with cycles of disturbance and recovery occurring on time scales of years. Much longer data sets (decades to evaluate the role of disturbance relative to other centuries) will likely be needed to properly processes in determining patterns of NPP in other systems.},

Secondary flow features that bear on the performance of forest

200{\%}. An offshore current on the order of 1 cm s21 developed
within the kelp bed, likely due to pressure gradients established
across the forest coupled with topography. Wake recirculations

can interact with (and thus potentially filter) substantial
portions of impinging waters; in our study, 40–90{\%} of arriving

abstract = {Reproduction is closely tied to environmental conditions and the
availability of resources, and thus typically varies with season.
Consequently, perennial organisms that reproduce continuously are
generally restricted to tropical regions with relatively
aseasonal climates. The temperate marine alga Macrocystis
pyrifera is a rare exception in this regard, as most individuals
reproduce throughout the year in a seasonally variable habitat.
Here we measure reproductive responses of the giant kelp
Macrocystis during a period in which resources and environmental
conditions fluctuated greatly and contrast these responses with
those of the palm kelp, Pterygophora californica, a sympatric
species that exhibits strictly seasonal reproduction. The
quantity and quality of spore production tracked resource
availability within and among years for Macrocystis, but not for
Pterygophora. Reproductive allocation and spore standing stock in
Macrocystis were negatively correlated with seawater temperature
and positively correlated with the nitrogen content of adult
plants. Macrocystis generally dis- played two seasonally distinct
peaks in spore production per year (winter and spring). The only
disruption of this pattern coincided with a warmwater El Ninio
event. Although seawater temperature and the nitrogen content of
adults were inversely related in Pterygophora, neither variable
was significantly correlated with the quantity or quality of
spore production in this species. Unlike Macrocystis,
Pterygophora exhibited a well-defined reproductive season in
which plants displayed a single broad peak in spore production
that varied little in timing and magnitude among years, even
during El Nifio conditions. Spore C/N ratios remained relatively
constant over time in both species, despite large seasonal
fluctuations in C/N ratios of vegetative tissue of adults plants.
Nonetheless, spore C/N ratios were positively correlated with
seawater temperature in Macrocystis, but not in Pterygophora.
Spore viability (swimming and germination) varied considerably,
and often unpredictably, over time for both species. Our results
support the general idea that environmental conditions and
resources exert a much greater influence on the quantity and
quality of reproduction in species that reproduce continuously
than on the majority of species that are strictly seasonal in
onset of repro- duction. The differential responses of
Macrocystis and Pterygophora may reflect their different
morphologies and life-spans. Macrocystis is relatively short
lived and may ``hedge its bets'' by reproducing continuously
rather than risk delaying reproduction. Conversely, since
Pterygophora lives much longer, plants can afford to release
spores only during times when the chances for reproductive
success are predictably greatest because these plants are likely
to reproduce again in subsequent years. Key},

abstract = {The 1997-98 El Nino was one of the strongest on record and resulted in widespread losses of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Agardh) along the west coast of North America. Drawing on a rich history of studies that have shown abnormally large waves and warm nutrient-poor water associated with El Ninos to negatively impact giant kelp populations at some locations in southern and Baja California, we examined (1) how these impacts scale up when considered across the species' geographic range in the NE Pacific Ocean and (2) if these impacts are generalizable over broad spatial scales. Working at 56 sites in 14 study locations over a 3 yr period (1997 to 2000), we examined how giant kelp populations were impacted by and recovered following the 1997-98 El Niho over a similar to 1500 km span along the west coast of North America. Our results indicate that while nearly all giant kelp disappeared from the southern one-third of the species' range along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, and heavy losses occurred throughout the central one-third of the species' range in southern California, USA, only minor impacts were observed throughout the northern one-third of the species' range in central California. Further, although highly variable among regions, these impacts were similar and generalizable among locations within each region. Our results also suggest that, as has been observed in local-scale studies, this large-scale variability in giant kelp mortality was driven by large-scale patterns in ocean temperature (nutrient concentration) and wave intensity. Recovery following El Niho, in contrast, was variable at multiple spatial scales and although not directly tested here, presumably influenced by numerous factors such as proximity to upwelling areas, competition with other algae, grazing, and propagule availability. Further, variability in the rates of recovery among locations resulted in a generally slow recovery of giant kelp throughout most of Baja California, and residual large-scale impacts of the El Niho were still evident 2 yr after the El Niho ended. As global climate change may lead to increases in the frequency and intensity of El Ninos, our findings have broad implications for the ways in which ecosystems might be expected to respond to them and provide a measure by which their impacts to giant kelp ecosystems may be compared among events.},

during austral spring of 2002–2005, 2008 and 2010. In the
southernmost Magellan Region (MR), benthic M. pyrifera were
additionally sampled to compare the community structures in both
conditions. Floating kelps were abundant throughout the entire
PFR, harbouring a diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna. The
density of floating kelps increased towards the south. In the
MR, a loss of species was observed between benthic and floating
condition (e.g. decapods, echinoderms, several peracarid
species), but a high diversity of organisms from all major phyla
were observed on rafts. Throughout the PFR, the predominant
rafting species belonged to the peracarids, molluscs and
annelids, but the community composition differed between
floating samples from the northern and southern zones of the
PFR. Relative abundances of peracarids were higher in northern
zones, whereas molluscs and annelids dominated in the southern
areas. Species of the peracarid genera Peramphithoe,
Gondogeneia, Bircenna and Limnoria were shared between all
areas. The results suggest that kelp rafts not only contribute
to local population connectivity in the PFR, but could also be
an important dispersal vehicle for rafting species along the PFR
in north–south direction, crossing the biogeographic boundary
around Taitao Peninsula. Furthermore, the MR appears to be an
important stepping stone for species dispersal via kelp rafting
in the subantarctic region.},

in intertidal and subtidal habitats along rocky shores. Although
this feature of wave-driven water motion is well recognized, the
mechanics of force imposition on compliant organisms is
incompletely understood. Here we undertake a field examination
of two processes that are thought to impose many of the more
dangerous forces that act on flexible benthic seaweeds:
impingement of breaking waves directly on emergent organisms,
and inertial effects tied to the rapid deceleration of mass that
occurs when a passively moving but attached organism abruptly
reaches the extent of its range of motion. We focus on two
common and important seaweed species: one intertidal kelp
(Egregia menziesii) and one subtidal kelp (Macrocystis
pyrifera). Results support the concept that wave impingement and
inertial effects produce intermittent force transients whose
magnitudes commonly exceed values readily attributable to drag.
Peak force transients are elevated by as much as a factor of 3
relative to drag in both small and large individuals, consistent
with smaller seaweeds being more susceptible to brief
impingement forces, and larger seaweeds being more vulnerable to
inertial forces. Because both wave impingement and inertial
effects vary with the size of an organism, they may have the
potential to influence the demographics of physical disturbance
in an array of flexible species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of vicariance events on the establishment of phylogeographic patterns in the marine environment is well documented, and generally accepted as an important cause of cladogenesis. Founder dispersal (i.e. long-distance dispersal followed by founder effect speciation) is also frequently invoked as a cause of genetic divergence among lineages, but its role has long been challenged by vicariance biogeographers. Founder dispersal is likely to be common in species that colonize remote habitats by means of rafting (e.g. seahorses), as long-distance dispersal events are likely to be rare and subsequent additional recruitment from the source habitat is unlikely. In the present study, the relative importance of vicariance and founder dispersal as causes of cladogenesis in a circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage was investigated using molecular dating. A phylogeny was reconstructed using sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear markers, and the well-documented closure of the Central American seaway was used as a primary calibration point to test whether other bifurcations in the phylogeny could also have been the result of vicariance events. The feasibility of three other vicariance events was explored: a) the closure of the Indonesian Seaway, resulting in sister lineages associated with the Indian Ocean and West Pacific, respectively; b) the closure of the Tethyan Seaway, resulting in sister lineages associated with the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, respectively, and c) continental break-up during the Mesozoic followed by spreading of the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in pairs of lineages with amphi-Atlantic distribution patterns. RESULTS: Comparisons of pairwise genetic distances among the seahorse species hypothesized to have diverged as a result of the closure of the Central American Seaway with those of published teleost sequences having the same distribution patterns show that the seahorses were among the last to diverge. This suggests that their cladogenesis was associated with the final closure of this seaway. Although two other divergence events in the phylogeny could potentially have arisen as a result of the closures of the Indonesian and Tethyan seaways, respectively, the timing of the majority of bifurcations in the phylogeny differed significantly from the dates of vicariance events suggested in the literature. Moreover, several divergence events that resulted in the same distribution patterns of lineages at different positions in the phylogeny did not occur contemporaneously. For that reason, they cannot be the result of the same vicariance events, a result that is independent of molecular dating. CONCLUSION: Interpretations of the cladogenetic events in the seahorse phylogeny based purely on vicariance biogeographic hypotheses are problematic. We conclude that the evolution of the circumglobally distributed seahorse lineage was strongly influenced by founder dispersal, and suggest that this mode of speciation may be particularly important in marine organisms that lack a pelagic dispersal phase and instead disperse by means of rafting.},

High concentrations of leachates, reaching 5,640 mg carbon1 super(-1) subsequently appear beneath the decomposing kelp. Over 90{\%} of the carbon in these leachates is utilised by bacteria during drainage through a strip of sand 1 m long, 50 cm wide and 12 cm deep, although on an open beach other organisms, e. g. nematodes, may be capable of direct absorption of such organic matter. Calculation of carbon flow via grazing invertebrates and through bacteria shows that 23-27{\%} of the carbon in kelp is converted to bacterial carbon. Estimates of the bacterial carbon in equilibrium with the kelp cast up on the strandline suggest that 1648 g of kelp carbon is deposited per metre of strandline each 8 d.},
annote = {{\textgreater} This paper summarises the results of studies made on the realtive rate of utilisation of kelp by the dominant consumers and by microheterotrophic decomposer organisms. The results allowed us to make some quantitative estimates of the relative significance of consumer organisms and microheterotrophic pathways in the energetics of the sandy beach community. Stydy site was located at Kommetjie. Sampling included invertebrate consumer species, microbial communities and biochemical components. 

{\textgreater} The results presented in this study suggest that bacteria are primarily responsible for the decomposistion and subsequent utilisation of kelp debris on the strandline, rather than fungi as generlly reported. Succession of microbial communities was also clear. 

{\textgreater} Lysis of the cells, most likely through bacterial decomposition, results in the release of high concentrations of dissolved organic matter as leachates immediatey below decomposing kelp. Values as high as 5640 mg carbon l(-1) was recorded. The high concentrations of such compounds may result in the direct absorption by eiofauna which occurs under natural conditions in more mature sand columns on sandy open beaches. 

{\textgreater} In the microcosom study, it was found that of 100 grams carbon in kelp 8.9{\%} was consumed by invertebrates.

{\textgreater} Broader study showed that 74{\%} of bech-cast kelp is consumed by the amphipod Talorchestia capensis and the diperan larvae Fucellia capensis, and the dipteran larva of Fucellia capensis.

{\textgreater} Carbon flow analyses of both decomposer and consumer dominated systems suggest that some 23 -27{\%} of the carbon from kelp is assimilated into large standing stock of bacterial carbon in the intertidal zone whilst the residual 73 to 77{\%} of the carbon from kelp is rapidly mineralised by the sand beach bacteria within {\~{}}8 days. This microbrial action is similar to what has been reported for water comlumns and therefore microbial communities play a central role in the rapid regeneration of inorganic materials needed to support the high primary production of a kelp bed.

important source of natural products. As a key component of
coastal ecosystems, they buffer changes in nutrient
concentrations in the water column and stabilise sediments.
Macroalgae show distinct zonation patterns, with a preference to
establish on hard bottom at different water depths. The
environment of Arctic coastal ecosystems is highly variable
(Kirst and Wiencke 1995). Especially, algae from the intertidal
zone have to withstand multiple changes in abiotic factors due
to tidal changes (Davison and Pearson 1996). During emersion,
these species have to resist desiccation, high solar
irradiances, changes in salinity and temperature and, under
conditions of low air temperatures, also freezing (Dudgeon et
al. 1989, 1995). In the field, the species inhabiting the
intertidal (e.g. Fucus distichus) or the upper sublittoral zone
(e.g. Alaria esculenta, Devaleraea ramentacea) also frequently
have to cope with temporarily high ultraviolet radiation (UVR)
and high intensities of photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR). In contrast, species restricted to deep waters (such as
Ptilota plumosa, Phycodrys rubens, Laminaria solidungula) are
hardly exposed to high irradiance as they are protected by the

abstract = {Hormosira banksii shows a considerable degree of morphological
variability throughout its range in south-eastern Australia,
apparently in relation to the local habitat, and there have been
several previous qualitative attempts to categorize this
variation by recognizing ecoforms. From our quantitative
morphometric analyses of plants from 21 sites covering 300 km of
coastline in south-eastern Australia, using multiple
discriminant function analysis based on seven vesicle
characteristics (measuring size and shape), there is very little
evidence of intergrading forms. The morphological variation is
not multivariately continuous, as has been previously suggested,
although each individual attribute does show more-or-less
continuous variation, and the morphological variation is not a
simple reflection of habitat but reflects more complex
microhabitat relationships. The morphological forms that we
recognize are multivariate, and thus all of the attributes need
to be considered. In particular, volume (or surface area:volume
ratio) is usually a very good discriminator between groups,
indicating that both size and shape are important for defining
the groups. We recognize two main phenotypically distinct
groups, comprising plants from sheltered estuarine situations
and those from exposed marine rock platforms. The vesicles of
plants from the estuarine habitats are more-or-less spherical
(length≈diameter), with a volume approximately 3–10 times that
of vesicles from the marine plants; it is thus probable that the
variation in the vesicle dimensions of these morphs can be
linked to desiccation resistance. The estuarine and marine
habitats are likely to be ecologically isolated from each other,
and there is therefore unlikely to be a great deal of gene flow
between these plants; if they are treated as separate species,
then they would be H. banksii (Turner) Decaisne and H. sieberi
(Bory) Decaisne, respectively. Three relatively distinct
morphometric forms were also recognizable within the marine
group, including plants from the bottom of rock pools; from rock
pool edges and sublittoral regions; and from the surface of rock
pools and exposed parts of the platforms. Two less distinctive
morphometric forms were recognizable within the estuarine group,
including plants from tidal flats and those from mangrove
forests. The taxonomic status of these microhabitat forms
remains uncertain.},

waves, wave energy is propagated over large distances. In the
class of discrete spectral models such propagation suffers from
a disintegration of the initial wave field into many individual

treatment of finite spectral bands as individual wave
components. It is shown in the present study that this effect
can be avoided by including two correction terms in the commonly
used energy balance equation of the waves. One of these terms
accounts for longitudinal (frequency) dispersion, the other term
accounts for lateral (directional) dispersion. These terms are
derived from the energy balance of finite spectral bands and
they are expressed in terms of the spectral band
characteristics. Since their nature is that of diffusion terms,
they are local operators, which is computationally convenient.
However, the coefficients of these terms are not locally
determined. To illustrate the effect of the proposed correction
terms, the propagation of swell from a distant storm (oceanic

abstract = {In many marine species, high levels of gene flow ensure that the genetic signal from population differentiation is weak. As a consequence, various errors associ- ated with estimating population genetic parameters that might normally be safely ignored assume a relatively greater importance. This fact has important implica- tions for the use of genetic data to address two common questions in fishery con- servation and management: (1) How many stocks of a given species are there? and (2) How much gene flow occurs among stocks? This article discusses strategies to maximize the signal:noise ratio in genetic studies of marine species and sug- gests a quantitative method to correct for bias due to a common sampling problem. For many marine species, however, genetic methods alone cannot fully resolve these key management questions because the amount of migration necessary to eliminate most genetic evidence of stock structure (only a handful of individuals per generation) will generally be inconsequential as a force for rebuilding depleted populations on a time scale of interest to humans. These limitations emphasize the importance of understanding the biology and life history of the target species— first, to guide design of the sampling program, and second, so that additional in- formation can be used to supplement indirect estimates of migration rates based on genetic data.},

abstract = {Phlorotannins, C-based defence compounds in brown seaweeds, show a high degree of spatial and temporal vari- ationwithin seaweed species. One important model explaining this variation is the CarbonNutrient BalanceModel (CNBM), which states that the relative supply of carbon and limiting nutrients will determine the level of defence compounds in plants. Nitrogen is often considered to be the limiting nutrient for marine macroalgal growth and the CNBM thus predicts that when the carbon:nitrogen ratio is high, photosynthetically fixed carbon will be allocated to production of phlorotannins. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of light (i.e. carbon) and nitrogen on the phlorotannin content of two intertidal brown seaweeds, Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus.This was done in an observational field study, as well as in a manipulative experiment where plants from habitats with different light regimes were subjected to different nitrogen and light treatments, and their phlorotannin content was measured after 14 days. The results showed that there was a negative relationship between tissue nitrogen and phlorotannin content in natural populations of F. vesiculosus, but not in A. nodosum. In the short term, the phlorotannin content in both algal specieswas not affected by changes in nitrogen availability. Exposure to sunlight had a positive effect on the phlorotannin content in natural populations of both algal species but, in themanipulative experiment, only F. vesiculosus showed a rapid response to changes in light intensities. Plants subjected to sunlight contained higher phlorotannin content than shaded plants. In conclusion, the results imply that nitrogen availability explains some of the natural variation in the phlorotannin content of F. vesiculosus, but the light environment has greater importance than nitrogen availability in predicting the phlorotannin content of each species.},

of S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} island. The papers dealing with these fishes were
compilations of previous works or the results of a few scientific
expeditions (e.g. ``Galathea'' and ``Calypso''). In this paper,
we present the results of several surveys carried out from the
island over the last decade, together with an annotated revision
of the known bibliography for the area. The result is an
inventory of the coastal fish of S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} island. Our records
(124 species belonging to 59 families) are based on fish
captured, photographed or observed whilst diving and also on
those landed by local artisanal fishermen. In this paper we
report a total of 185 confirmed coastal species and 67 families.
Twenty-seven of these are reported for the first time for the
area, and three other unidentified species may represent new
species to science. The best represented families are Carangidae
(14 species), Serranidae (11 species), Gobiidae and Scombridae (8
species each). Despite its proximity to the African Continent, it
is clear that these islands harbour a particular fish fauna,
including several amphiatlantic species, which, in the eastern
Atlantic, occur only around oceanic islands (e.g., Epinephelus
ascencionis, Paranthias furcifer, Mulloidychtis martinicus,
Bodianus pulchellus, Chromis multilineata, Gnatholepis thomsoni,
Melychthis niger). The coastal ichthyodiversity of S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} is
apparently poorer than that of the adjacent coasts, showing a
significant influence of the islands further west, St. Helena and
Ascencion.},

Hydrographic, ADCP, wind, and remotely sensed SST data during
the upwelling season reflect the interplay of two contrasting
regimes in the region: coastal upwelling and a nearshore
countercurrent. The observations revealed a 40km wide jet-like
flow, separated from the coast, that advected cold water
southward off the west coast and eastward around the Cape. It
originated prior to the cruise in the upwelling that occurred
off the prominent west coast capes, north of the sampling
region. Adjacent to the coast, a narrow inshore counterflow
advected warm water westward along the south coast, curled
anticyclonically around the Cape with velocities up to 0.4ms−1,
and progressed poleward inshore of the previously upwelled
water. The cold equatorward jet interacted with offshore waters
and inshore countercurrent by generating small-scale
instabilities, and weakened as it proceeded south and around the
Cape. The inshore countercurrent was suppressed during the final
part of the survey by an eastward flow associated with a return
to an upwelling favourable wind off the south coast of Portugal.},

abstract = {Light is the fundamental driver of primary productivity in the marine environment. Reduced light availability has the potential to alter the distribution, community composition, and pro- ductivity of key benthic primary producers, potentially reducing habitat and energy provision to coastal food webs. We compared the underwater light environment of macroalgal domi- nated shallow subtidal rocky reef habitats on a coastline modified by human activities with a coastline of forested catchments. Key metrics describing the availability of photosynthetical- ly active radiation (PAR) were determined over 295 days and were related to macroalgal depth distribution, community composition, and standing biomass patterns, which were re- corded seasonally. Light attenuation was more than twice as high in shallow subtidal zones along the modified coast. Macroalgal biomass was 2–5 times greater within forested sites, and even in shallow water (2m) a significant difference in biomass was observed. Long- term light dose provided the best explanation for differences in observed biomass between − modified and forested coasts, with light availability over the study period differing by 60 and 90 mol photonsm 2 at 2 and 10 metres, respectively. Higher biomass on the forested coast was driven by the presence of larger individuals rather than species diversity or density. This study suggests that commonly used metrics such as species diversity and density are not as sensitive as direct measures of biomass when detecting the effects of light limitation withinmacroalgal communities.

Experimental sites typical of the area were permanently marked. A study site was protected from urchins, while the control was not. Urchins were regularly removed from the study site. Kelps growing on the experimental plots were harvested seasonally, counted and their biomass calculated.

abstract = {Trophic models of three upwelling ecosystems, the southern
Benguela (South African), southern Humboldt (Chilean) and
northern Humboldt (Peruvian) systems, have been fitted to catch,
abundance and fishing mortality time-series. Three drivers were
considered during the model fitting: internal forcing by means
of the trophic flow controls between the various interacting
species groups, and two kinds of external forcing, namely
fishing and the environment. The southern Benguela model was
fitted to time-series data from 1978 to 2003, the southern
Humboldt model to data from 1970 to 2004, and the northern
Humboldt to data for a shorter period, 1995?2004. Fishing has
been relatively carefully managed in the southern Benguela
during the period modelled and previous studies found that most
of the resource variability was attributed to internal
trophodynamic forcing and to environmental forcing rather than
to fishing. By comparison, fishing has been shown to have played
a relatively major role in driving ecosystem changes observed in
the southern and northern Humboldt models. Bearing in mind the
different roles played by each of the drivers in these
ecosystems, flow controls between interacting species groups,
which improved the fits of the models, were compared across the
three ecosystems to determine to what extent the three models
supported the hypothesis that upwelling ecosystems function as
wasp-waist systems. Secondly, environmental forcing was examined
by searching for hypothetical forcing functions, affecting
different levels of the foodweb, which improved the model fits.
This was an attempt to start to uncover the processes that may
be involved in linking the environment to observed ecosystem
dynamics and changes in these upwelling ecosystems. Model
results confirmed the important ecological role played by small
pelagic fish in the studied upwelling ecosystems. For example,
the fit of the southern Benguela model to time-series data of
catch and abundance was similarly improved when
anchovy/sardine?prey and anchovy/sardine?predator interactions
were externally forced, supporting the wasp-waist hypothesis. In
addition, although physical drivers and conditions may differ in
their nature or merely their frequency and intensity between
systems, and different fishing strategies operate in each of the
three ecosystems, model results suggest that these effects are
transferred through the ecosystems and manifest themselves as
ecosystem changes and observed resource dynamics largely via
interactions with small pelagic fish.},

abstract = {Photosynthetic rates of seagrasses have until recently been measured as gas exchange of chamber-enclosed leaves mainly in the laboratory, and in situ measurements under natural conditions are scarce. In this work we explore the possibility of measuring such rates by pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry, using a newly developed underwater device. This was done by first comparing photosynthetic O-2 evolution (net photosynthesis corrected for dark respiration) with rates of electron transport (ETR) derived from fluorescence measurements of the effective quantum yield of photosystem II multiplied with the estimated photon flux of photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by this photosystem In the field, ETRs were then measured both as rapid light curves (RLCs) and by in situ point measurements under ambient light during the day. Photosynthetic O-2 evolution showed a linear relationship with ETR within a range of irradiances for the Mediterranean seagrass Cymodocea nodosa, while the tropical Halophila stipulacea and a temperate intertidal population of Zostera marina exhibited decreasing O-2 evolution rates relative to ETRs at high irradiances. These differences are Likely due to photorespiration, which is absent in C. nodosa. The molar ratio between photosynthetic O-2 evolution and ETR within the range of their linear relationship was found to be 0.3 for C. nodosa, which is close to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 0.25, but was higher and lower for Z. marina and H. stipulacea, respectively. Point measurements of ETR in the field showed good agreements with rates derived from RLCs for H, stipulacea and Z. marina, but values varied greatly between replicate measurements for C. nodosa at high irradiances. It is speculated that this variation was partly due to light-flecks caused by waves in the shallow water where these measurements were done. In all, this work shows that PAM fluorometry can efficiently yield photosynthetic rates for seagrasses in the laboratory, without the typical lag experienced by O-2 electrodes, as well as in situ under natural conditions which are not disturbed by enclosures.

turtle-nesting site in the central Great Barrier Reef region of
Australia. We ran simulations to investigate the effects of
spring versus neap tides, hatchling's swimming behaviour during
their first three days at sea, and the location of nesting
beaches. The model predicted that up to 50{\%} of the turtle
hatchlings entering the sea from the windward, southern beach
remained after 14 days in shallow, nearshore waters,
irrespective of tides and swimming. These waters are turbid and
may be inhospitable to hatchlings. In contrast {\textgreater}80{\%} of
hatchlings dispersing from the leeward, northern beach were
dispersed to deeper water (10–40m) in a quasi-stationary
dispersion core centred around 10km north of the nesting beach
after 14 days and the offshore spread of the turtle plume was
enhanced by the hatchling's seaward swimming during the first
three days. This was due to the presence of a coastal boundary
layer and a stagnation zone around the northern side of island,
but not the southern side. The model confirmed that dispersal
from eastern Queensland flatback turtle rookeries is restricted
to the lagoons and coastal waters, and that water circulation
and hatchling's swimming control dispersion. The model explains
why more turtles nest on the northern than the southern side.

abstract = {The green macroalga, Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, is an
important component of sheltered low-shore assemblages on
breakwaters along sandy shores in the northern Adriatic Sea.
Macroscopic thalli of C. fragile are not perennial, but develop
from propagules and/or undifferentiated forms in early spring,
when the dominant native space-occupier, the mussel Mytilus
galloprovincialis, recruits. By mid-summer, rapid growth of C.
fragile leads to the formation of a dense canopy. We investigated
the effects of juvenile and adult thalli of C. fragile on
recruitment, survival and growth of mussels. Two experiments
tested the hypotheses: (1) that recruitment of mussels is greater
within patches of juvenile thalli (primordia) of C. fragile than
on adjacent bare surfaces; (2) that the presence of a canopy of
C. fragile affects the survival and growth of mussel recruits.
The number of recruits of mussels was significantly larger within
clumps of primordia of C. fragile than on bare surfaces. The
removal of the canopy of C. fragile affected negatively the
density of mussels after 2 months from the start of the
experiment, but there were no effects on the mean size of
individuals, nor on the size-frequency distribution. The same
trend persisted after 4 months from the start of the experiment.
These results show that re-colonisation of space by mussels is
enhanced by C. fragile. Given that mussels, in turn, have the
potential to reduce recruitment rates of C. fragile, quick
recovery of mussel beds after disturbances could be crucial for
controlling the abundance of this alga on breakwaters. Results
also suggest that the effects of introduced species on native
assemblages can be explained only through studies encompassing
different life-stages of interacting organisms.},

Mean concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), primarily NOx −-N, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in intertidal pore water varied significantly among beaches (ranges=1 to 6,553 $\mu$M and 7 to 2,006 $\mu$M, respectively). Intertidal DIN and DON concentrations were significantly correlated with wrack biomass. Surf zone concentrations of DIN were also strongly correlated with wrack biomass and with intertidal DIN, suggesting export of nutrients from re-mineralized wrack. Our results suggest beach ecosystems can process and re-mineralize substantial organic inputs and accumulate dissolved nutrients, which are subsequently available to nearshore waters and primary producers.},

abstract = {Whereas zooplankton in most eastern boundary current systems (EBCSs) studied to date has declined in terms of biomass over the past 5 decades, it has increased 100-fold in terms of numerical abundance in the southern Benguela region, thereby undergoing a displacement in species composition through time. These long-term changes in coastal zooplankton off South Africa have previously been hypothesized to be mediated by both "bottom-up" and "top-down" control mechanisms, in contrast to other EBCSs and marine ecosystems in general which have traditionally been viewed to be structured from below. From a "bottom-up" perspective, the increase in zooplankton abundance is a long-term biological response to intensified coastal upwelling, common to EBCSs, and its associated processes of nutrient enrichment and increased phytoplankton production and biomass. On the other hand, such increase in zooplankton and the accompanying shift in its community structure are thought to result from a "cascading" trophic effect of predator-prey interactions between apex predators and their small pelagic forage species, and between the latter and their zooplanktonic prey. This study provides new information in terms of decadal- scale increasing trends in nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass off the West Coast of South Africa, lending support to the above "bottom-up" hypothesis. In addition, published data on long-term, density-dependent increases in pelagic fish condition and maturity are interpreted within the context of the above "top-down" mechanism which is postulated to control zooplankton populations in the Benguela region concurrently with "bottom- up" mechanisms.

sigma transformation model offers perhaps the best solution.
Accordingly, in the simulations presented in this paper, the
double sigma coordinate model was applied as a diagnostic tool
to calculate features of ocean circulation off the coast of
Western Europe, particularly in the area between La Chapelle
Bank and Porcupine Bank. Calculations derived from the model
indicated density-driven poleward currents continuous from the

abstract = {Coastal ocean upwelling ecosystems generally represent the most productive large marine ecosystems of the world's oceans, in terms of both primary production rates and tonnages of exploitable fish produced. The Peruvian upwelling system, in particular, stands out as a major factor in world fish production. The Pacific trade winds have traditionally been considered to be the primary driving force for the upwelling system off Peru, but are projected to weaken as climate change proceeds. This leads to concern that the upwelling process in the Peru system, to which its productivity is linked, may likewise weaken. However, other mechanisms involving greenhouse-associated intensification of thermal low-pressure cells over the coastal landmasses of upwelling regions suggest general intensification of wind-driven ocean upwelling in coastal upwelling regions of the world's oceans. But although certain empirical results have supported this expectation, it has not been consistently corroborated in climate model simulations, possibly because the scale of the coastal intensification may be small relative to the scales that are appropriately reflected in the standard models. Here we summarize available evidence for the intensification mechanism and present a proxy test that uses variations in water vapor, the dominant natural greenhouse gas, to offer multiple-realization empirical evidence for action of the proposed mechanism in the real world situation. While many potential consequences to the future of marine ecosystems would codepend on climate change-related changes in the thermocline and nutricline structures, an important subset, involving potential increased propensities for hypoxia, noxious gas eruptions, toxic red tide blooms, and/or jellyfish outbreaks, may depend more directly on changes in the upwelling-favorable wind itself. A prospective role of fisheries in either mitigating or reinforcing this particular class of effects is suggested.},

radiata, an important component of subtidal reef habitats on the
central coast of New South Wales, Australia. Herbivory by Odax
has a major impact on the structure and dynamics of discrete
patches within larger stands of kelp at Cape Banks. This
three-year study showed that each year, between August and
October, approximately the same patches of kelp were denuded by
preferential feeding on the meristem and primary laminae. This
coincided with a variable pulse of Ecklonia recruits to the
cleared patches, thereby generating patches of a single age-class
of plants. Neighbouring areas of Ecklonia forest, non cleared by
Odax, consisted of larger, perennial plants, which exhibited more
gradual changes in abundance. The seasonal impact of Odax
appeared to be due to a change in the behaviour of female Odax
during their spawning period. Observations suggested that females
aggregate at traditional sites prior to spawning with territorial
males in adjacent areas of kelp forest. An alternative
hypothesis, that Odax preferentially attacked stands of one-year
old Ecklonia plants, was rejected by a field experiment; the
establishment of experimental stands of one-year old plants did
not lead to increased damage due to Odax or any change in the use
of space by the fish. The generality of this effect of fish
herbivory is unknown, but this and other Odax species are widely
distributed throughout temperate Australia, where Ecklonia is the
dominant laminarian alga. The effects of pulsed herbivory by Odax
is contrasted to the more continuous grazing by sea urchins in
the same system. The latter herbivore has been shown to maintain
areas free of Ecklonia, the long-term effects of herbivory by
Odax remain unclear.},

aerial photographs from 1986 to 1989 and SCUBA surveys from 1993
to 1995 indicated a significant positive relationship between
wave intensity and depth of the upper limit of giant kelp;
increased wave intensity resulted in the upper limit moving
offshore into deeper water presumably due to direct removal of
adult giant kelp plants by waves. Further, during periods of high
wave intensity, plants with canopies were restricted to deeper
water than those without canopies, suggesting that wave- induced
giant kelp mortality was related to plant biomass (i.e. drag).
Removal of giant kelp from shallow water (??? 2.5 m depth) during
periods of high wave intensity may have facilitated the
development of dense algal turf assemblages by reducing light
limitation; clearing experiments indicated that algal turf
inhibited giant kelp recruitment at depths ??? 2.5 m. Under
extended periods of low wave intensity, however, giant kelp can
establish populations in shallow water as indicated by the
shallower depth of continuous giant kelp canopies with decreasing
wave exposure. Thus, algal community structure in these shallow
subtidal regions along the Monterey Peninsula appears to be
determined by disturbance-mediated competition; with a lack of
disturbance favoring giant kelp, disturbance favoring algal turf.
These data support the hypothesis that the upper limit of giant

The model is tested by comparing it with microwave radar observations of a tethered float. The modeling of kelp frond motion uses parameters derived from current meter observations as input data. The results indicate that the relative velocity of seawater to the kelp frond is rarely zero and often is of comparable magnitude to the local Eulerian velocity of the water relative to the seabed. This has ramifications for modeling of both drag and boundary-layer transport processes. Use of a monochromatic wave field in the modeling in conjunction with examination of the results in the time domain suggests the magnitude of the current is very important in controlling motion at frequencies lower than the wave frequency.},

populations) using two alternative methods described by Wright
and Slatkin. For most species, these two methods give
approximately congruent estimates of Nm; when estimates differ,
the method of Wright produces values slightly larger than those
derived by the method of Slatkin. We analyze these results in
light of independently derived historical inferences of the
fragmentation of populations. This analysis suggests that the Nm
values calculated from protein polymorphisms may contain
information more relevant to historical patterns of gene exchange
than to the current population dynamics; moderately large values
of Nm may be calculated for species containing populations known
to be no longer exchanging genes. Application of a method for
estimating the maximum possible rate of gene exchange among
populations indicates that, for most species studied here, gene
flow among populations probably is no greater than the mutation
rate. We suggest that most plethodontid species cannot be viewed
as units whose cohesion is maintained by continuing gene
exchange. Furthermore, we suggest that phenotypic uniformity
among populations is not easily explained by hypotheses of
continual stabilizing selection and propose that future work

abstract = {We have focused on the giant kelp Nereocystis luetkeana to examine the mechanical scaling of benthic marine organisms loaded in tension by hydrodynamic forces. If we consider simply the allometry of the kelp's morphological characters, we conclude that their stipes are underscaled relative to the blade area they support (i.e. that the kelp do not maintain stress or elastic similarity as they grow). However, a closer look at the characteristics of these kelp in the field reveals (1) that they have different blade shapes (and hence drag coefficients) and stipe material properties in different hydrodynamic environments, and (2) that they show a decrease in drag coefficient as they become larger. One consequence of these adjustments of blade and stipe morphology is that the maximum stresses in N. luetkeana stipes, when the kelp are pulled by peak tidal currents in their respective habitats, are similar for kelp of different sizes and for kelp from different sites. Hence, sessile organisms such as these kelp can, via their growth responses in different mechanical environments, show a phenomenon analogous to dynamic strain similarity. In addition, N. luetkeana also maintain a constant environmental stress factor, the ratio of the stress required to break a component of an organism (in this case the stipe) at some stage in its life to the maximum stress normally encountered in the habitat by that component during that stage (in this case, stress due to the drag on a kelp exposed to the peak tidal currents typical of the site at which it lives), both between habitats and as they grow.},

been rinsed of animals before being put afloat. Colonization of
experimental fronds was to some extent mediated through transfer
from small algal pieces caught by the fronds. Floating algal
clumps in coastal areas occur in a large range of sizes. Number
of species present on such clumps was closely related to clump
size. The density (numbers/100 g algae) of many intertidal

abstract = {1. Policy initiatives that seek to recover lost habitats require
the capacity to anticipate and suppress the mechanisms that drive
loss. The replacement of forested landscapes by simple landscapes
comprising of opportunistic or `weedy' species represents an
increasingly common phenomenon across human-dominated systems.
The failure of subtidal forests to recover from natural and human
disturbance and their ultimate replacement by degraded habitats
is recognized globally. The current lack of knowledge on whether
such shifts can be reversed jeopardizes considerations of
restoration policy within increasingly human-dominated
landscapes.2. We critically assessed the model that recovery of
canopies within remnant kelp forests in degraded landscapes (i.e.
turf-forming algae that carpet space) is slower than in adjacent
forested landscapes, but may be increased by removing turfs.3.
After generating experimental disturbance, canopies recovered to
their former state within forested landscapes, but not in remnant
forests in degraded landscapes. Removal of turfs from spaces
between remnant forests, however, enabled canopies to recruit and
subsequently develop covers that matched those in remnant
forests.4. Whilst the supply of canopy-forming propagules to
degraded landscapes is likely to decline with gap expansion, we
show that improvements to forest resilience and restoration are
possible via policies that result in a reduction of turf covers.
These results also support the model that regime-shifts need not
be a product of synchronized loss, but can occur as a result of
reduced rates of canopy-recruitment over broad areas and many
years. Indeed, patterns of canopy-loss over several decades
redouble attention to the human-mediated conditions that enable
turfs to retain space (i.e. elevated nutrient and sediment loads
via coastal runoff).5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate
that future restoration is a possible outcome of polices that
promote ecosystem recovery. In doing so, we reduce uncertainty
about policy initiatives that aim to upgrade the recycling
potential of wastewater treatment plants (e.g. nearly 45{\%} of
South Australia's metropolitan wastewater) to improve the quality
of water needed to restore subtidal forests. Uncertainty about
resilience-building and restoration management are redressed by
demonstrating that the feedbacks maintaining regime-shifted
landscapes are not necessarily permanent.},

The only substantial perturbation occurs with the irregular
passage of a Natal Pulse, a soliton meander. The initiation of
this meander at the Natal Bight is due to a barotropic
instability when the intensity of the landward border of the

with natural fluctuations in the current or with the adsorption
of deep-sea eddies onto the current. Under a climate change
scenario of altered wind stress curl over the South Indian Ocean
it is conceivable that the threshold for the triggering of a

abstract = {Patterns of survival of juvenile giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) were ex- amined in relation to grazing by sea urchins, shading by adult kelp, density of recruits, densities of other algal species, and substrate distribution. Survival was poorer in areas where white sea urchins (Lytechinus anamesus) were abundant or where there was an overlying canopy of adults. At other sites, the density of recruits explained the greatest proportion of variability in survival, and the proportion of juveniles that survived was negatively correlated with the number of recruits. Potential algal competitors (Pterygophora californica and Cystoseira osmundacea), red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), and substrate distributions had no significant effect on survival. The mechanisms of density-dependent survival were similar to "dominance and suppression" models that explain self-thinning in many terrestrial plant populations. In stands where densities of recruits were high, skewed size distributions developed, probably as the result of competition for light. High-density stands had proportionally more small plants than low-density stands, and, during subsequent storms, only the larger plants survived. This led to a more equitable distribution of survivors than would be expected based on the number of recruits. Intraspecific interactions, both between adults and juveniles and among juveniles of the same cohort, appear to be important structuring forces in most giant kelp populations. This parallels findings in many terrestrial populations. However, in other algal populations, there is little evidence for density-dependent mortality or for the dominance-suppression hypothesis. These differences may relate to competition for light, which is intense in Macrocystis forests and many terrestrial populations, but less so in assemblages of other benthic algae.},

Phase 1 is characterized by vertebrate apex predators such as Atlantic cod, haddock, and wolffish and persisted for more than 4,000 years. Phase 2 is characterized by herbivorous sea urchins and lasted from the 1970s to the 1990s. Phase 3 is dominated by invertebrate predators such as large crabs and has developed since 1995. Each phase change re- sulted directly or indirectly from fisheries-induced "trophic-level dysfunction," in which populations of functionally important species at higher trophic levels fell below the densities necessary to limit prey populations at lower trophic levels. By using frac- tional trophic-level analysis, we found that phase changes occurred rapidly (over a few years to a few decades) as well as relatively recently (over the past half-century). Interphase durations have declined as fishing effects have accelerated in recent years. The naturally low species diversity of the kelp forest ecosystem we studied may facilitate rapid changes because the redundancy within each trophic level is low. If the biodiversity within controlling trophic levels is a buffer against trophic-level dysfunction, then our observations from Maine may be predic- tive of the fate of other, more diverse systems. If fishing successively targets most, or all, strong in- teractors at higher trophic levels, then as those pop- ulation densities decline, the potential for trophic- level dysfunction and associated instabilities will increase.},

Here we use geological data to quantify the frequency of long-distance dispersal in detached bull-kelp (Phaeophyceae: Durvillaea) in southern New Zealand. Geological resolution in this region is enhanced by the presence of a number of distinct and readily-identifiable geological terranes. We sampled 13,815 beach-cast bull-kelp plants across 130 km of coastline. Rocks were found attached to 2639 of the rafted plants, and were assigned to specific geological terranes (source regions) to quantify dispersal frequencies and distances. Although the majority of kelp-associated rock specimens were found to be locally-derived, a substantial number (4{\%}) showed clear geological evidence of long-distance dispersal, several having travelled over 200 km from their original source regions. The proportion of local versus foreign clasts varied considerably between regions. While short-range dispersal clearly predominates, long-distance travel of detached bull-kelp plants is shown to be a common and ongoing process that has potential to connect isolated coastal populations.

abstract = {We formulated a dynamic model with linear wave theory to predict
the effects of wave height, wave length, and water depth on
modulation of the local surface cover in a Macrocystis pyrifera
canopy. This model was incorporated into a general model for
attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in a M.
pyrifera forest with particular emphasis on light reaching
understory algae. The model predicts that the period of
fluctuations of PAR on the bottom matches that of the dominant
wave period and that the amplitude of irradiance peaks is
increased by positive local surface areal stain during the trough
of a wave. Field measurements of instantaneous ir-radiance and
surface elevation and simultaneous video recording of the surface
canopy allowed investigation of these predictions.
Cross-correlation analysis on ir-radiance and surface elevation
measurements showed a significant negative correlation between
surface elevation and PAR reaching the understory. This
correlation cannot be attributed to the decrease in light-path
length alone, but can be explained by the change in M. pyrifera
surface cover. Measured changes in instantaneous fractional
canopy cover exceeded theoretically predicted values by a factor
of as much as 3. Consequently, the intensities of light flecks
exceeded predictions. A combination of mechanisms, as well as
assumptions of the model, may explain the deviation between the
magnitudes of predicted and measured fluctuations in canopy cover
and light. The dominant period of ocean swells is typically in
the range of 5-20 s, and light flashes with these periods have
been shown to effect significant gains in light utilization

To determine the effects of Centrostephanus grazing on the composition and diversity of the attached biota within these areas, I removed sea urchins from an experimental site and photographically monitored subsequent events in marked quad- rats at monthly intervals for 27 mo. Grazed and ungrazed control sites were similarly monitored. These observations were supplemented by dietary data obtained from grazed control site urchins at the end of the experiment, permitting assessment of food preferences through the use of electivity indices. Taxonomic composition in the exclusion site changed dramatically following urchin removal, nearly converging to that of the ungrazed control site. Algae, sponges, tunicates, and erect bryozoa replaced encrusting coralline algae and encrusting bryozoa as the dominants. The urchin's diet in- cludes all of these taxa, and the most preferred ones increase most upon urchin removal. Taxonomic diversity increased in the exclusion site as a result of replacement of a small number of taxa which can withstand urchin grazing by a larger number of competitively superior ones which cannot. Thus the effect of Centrostephanus on the community is to decrease diversity where it actually grazes, but to increase diversity in the community as a whole by creating local environmental patches favorable to otherwise rare taxa},

abstract = {An open ocean shoreface typical of long, wave-dominated sandy
coasts has been examined through a combination of extensive
field measurements of wave and current patterns with
computations of marine bedload transport and sedimentation. Sand
transport on the upper shoreface is dominantly controlled by
waves with only secondary transport by currents. Sand on the
middle and lower shoreface, as well as the inner continental
shelf is entrained by storm waves and transported by a complex
pattern of bottom boundary layer currents. Storm events have
been studied and modeled for the shoreface off Tiana Beach, Long
Island. The dominant effect of coastal frontal storms is to
cause significant shore-parallel bedload transport with
important shore-normal secondary components. These storms tend
to result in net offshore transport of sand removed from the
beach and surf zone systems. The bedload transport during a
storm is convergent on the shoreface leading to accretion. Most
accretion occurs on the upper shoreface with lesser deposits
covering the middle and lower shoreface as well as the inner
continental shelf. Longer-term equilibrium can be maintained by
slow return of sand up the shoreface during non-storm
conditions. Annual and geologic time-scale budgets of shoreface
sand transport and sedimentation yield equilibrium, net
accretion or net deposition. The annual balance results from an
integration of the event-scale bedload transport patterns and
morphologic responses. These processes and responses have
feedback mechanisms which stabilize the system over longer, but
not geologic, time scales. Geologic time scale balances are
controlled by relative sea level changes and relative
availability of sediment supply with the event-scale shoreface
and transporting processes providing the mechanism to produce
the changes in long-term morphology and sedimentation patterns.
In the area of study, the long-term pattern is one of net
shoreface erosion, and the permanent loss of sand to the shelf
floor.},

The density of the kelp canopy varied greatly during the 13 mo study, ranging from 0.03 to 8.03 m2 blade tissue m–2 sea surface. Time series analysis of flow velocity, light, temperature and seawater nitrate concentrations inside and out- side of the bed indicated that when canopy density was high (May to September) current speeds in the bed were 25{\%} of incident flow, and light below the canopy (at 1 m depth) was reduced to 10{\%} surface irradiance. Nitrate concentrations were highly variable and similar between inside and out- side moorings. When the canopy was well developed, kelp fronds on the seaward edge of the bed had faster elongation rates and larger blades, resulting in higher overall growth rates (mass added per day) than interior fronds. Carbon and nitrogen accumulation by edge fronds was also higher dur- ing this period, which fueled growth rates of edge fronds that were nearly twice as high as interior fronds when the canopy was densest. Thus, the growth and tissue chemistry of M. pyrifera within the kelp bed depended on the extent to which the bed modified ambient physical conditions.},

from differences in MBW. Whereas TW at the lower depth limit was

Unialgal cultures of the brown and red algae were maintained at 0°C, the green algae were cultivated at 10°C. IK values were between 18 and 53 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1 characteristic or low light adapted algae. Only the two Ulothrix species showed higher IK values between 70 and 74 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1. Photosynthesis compensated dark respiration at very low photon fluence rates between 1.6 and 10.6 $\mu$mol m−2 s−1. Values of $\alpha$ were high: between 0.4 and 1.1 $\mu$mol O2 g−1 FW h−1 ($\mu$mol m−2 s−1)−1 in the brown and red algae and between 2.1 and 4.9 $\mu$mol O2 g−1 FW h−1 ($\mu$mol m−2 s−1)−1 in the green algal species. At 0°C Pmax values of the brown and red algae ranged from 6.8 to 19.1 $\mu$mol O2 g−1 FW h−1 and were similarly high or higher than those of comparable Arctic-cold temperate species. Optimum temperatures for photosynthesis were 5 to 10°C in A. mirabilis, 10°C in H. grandifolius, 15°C in G. skottsbergii and 20°C or higher in D. anceps and I. cordata. P: R ratios strongly decreased in most brown and red algae with increasing temperatures due to different Q10 values for photosynthesis (1.4 to 2.5) and dark respiration (2.5 to 4.1). These features indicate considerable physiological adaptation to the prevailing low light conditions and temperatures of Antarctic waters. In this respect the lower depth distribution limits and the northern distribution boundaries of these species partly depend on the physiological properties described here.},

abstract = {Indirect facilitation can occur when a species positively affects another via the suppression of a shared competitor. In giant kelp forests, shade from the canopy of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, negatively affects understory algae, which compete with sessile invertebrates for space. This raises the possibility that giant kelp indirectly facilitates sessile invertebrates, via suppression of understory algae. We evaluated the effect of giant kelp on the relative abundance of algae and invertebrates by experimentally manipulating kelp abundance on large artificial reefs located off San Clemente, California, USA. The experiments revealed a negative effect of giant kelp on both light availability and understory algal abundance and a positive effect on the abundance of sessile invertebrates, which was consistent with an indirect effect mediated by shade from the kelp canopy. The importance of these processes to temporal variability in benthic community structure was evaluated at 16 locations on natural reefs off Santa Barbara, California, over an eight-year period. Interannual variability in the abundance of understory algae and in the abundance of sessile invertebrates was significantly and positively related to interannual variability in the abundance of giant kelp. Analysis of these observational data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that the magnitude of the indirect effect of giant kelp on invertebrates was six times larger than the direct effect on invertebrates. Results suggest that the dynamics of this system are driven by variability in the abundance of a single structure-forming species that has indirect positive, as well as direct negative, effects on associated species.},

abstract = {Beach grooming and beach award status are both shown to be
associated with low macroinvertebrate taxon richness in
Scotland. Previous studies in California have revealed that
mechanical raking to remove wrack from sandy beaches has
negative ecological consequences for coastal ecosystems. In the
current study the presence and absence of eight common taxa that
inhabit beached wrack on sandy beaches in Scotland was assessed
at 60 sites, 24 of which were groomed and 29 of which were in
receipt of a beach award. On average 4.86 of the eight taxa were
found to be present on ungroomed beaches, whereas only 1.13 taxa
were present on groomed beaches. Thus, beach grooming seems to
be having a major effect on the biodiversity of beach
macroinvertebrates in Scotland. Fewer macroinvertebrate taxa
were also found on award (1.5) compared to non-award (4.38)
beaches. It was also revealed that award beaches were much more
likely to be groomed than non-award beaches, with 69{\%} of award
beaches surveyed being groomed compared to only 6{\%} of non-award
beaches. This pattern is surprising as the awarding bodies
discourage the removal of seaweed and regulations state that
beached wrack should only be removed if it constitutes a
nuisance. It is concluded that award status, not nuisance level,
has the main factor driving most beach grooming and that this
has resulted in the substantial loss of macroinvertebrate
biodiversity from award beaches in Scotland. In conclusion it is
shown that beach grooming has a substantial negative impact upon
strandline macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Scotland and that
grooming is much more likely to occur on award beaches. ?? 2012

abstract = {Some 60{\%} of coastal rivers and bays in the U.S. have been
moderately to severely degraded by nutrient pollution. Both
nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contribute to the problem,
although for most coastal systems N additions cause more damage.
Globally, human activity has increased the flux of N and P from
land to the oceans by 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively. For N,
much of this increase has occurred over the past 40 years, with
the increase varying by region. Human activity has increased the
flux of N in the Mississippi River basin by 4-fold, in the
rivers of the northeastern U.S. by 8-fold, and in the rivers
draining to the North Sea by more than 10-fold. The sources of
nutrients to the coast vary. For some estuaries, sewage
treatment plants are the largest single input; for most systems
nonpoint sources of nutrients are now of relatively greater
importance, both because of improved point source treatment and
control (particularly for P) and because of increases in the
total magnitude of nonpoint sources (particularly for N) over
the past three decades. For P, agricultural activities dominate
nonpoint source fluxes. Agriculture is also the major source of
N in many systems, including the flux of N down the Mississippi
River, which has contributed to the large hypoxic zone in the
Gulf of Mexico. For both P and N, agriculture contributes to
nonpoint source pollution both through losses at the field
scale, as soils erode away and fertilizer is leached to surface
and ground waters, and from losses from animal feedlot
operations. In the U.S. N from animal wastes that leaks directly
to surface waters or is volatilized to the atmosphere as ammonia
may be the single largest source of N that moves from
agricultural operations into coastal waters. In some regions,
including the northeastern U.S., atmospheric deposition of
oxidized N from fossil-fuel combustion is the major flux from
nonpoint sources. This atmospheric component of the N flux into
estuaries has often been underestimated, particularly with
respect to deposition onto the terrestrial landscape with
subsequent export downstream. Because the relative importance of
these nutrient sources varies among regions and sites, so too
must appropriate and effective mitigation strategies. The
regional nature and variability of nutrient sources require that
nutrient management efforts address large geographic areas.},

abstract = {Determination of larval dispersal distances and larval origins
is a central challenge in contemporary marine ecology. In this
work, the larval dispersal problem is discussed from the
perspective of oceanography. Following formulation of the
advection?diffusion model, the importance of scale is argued.
When considering dispersion parameters at the appropriate
population scales, advection is usually weaker than initially
anticipated (and often used), and diffusion is stronger than
typically used in model studies. Focusing attention on coastal
populations, the importance of retention zones is described, and
the more general existence of a coastal boundary layer is
discussed. The coupling of cross-shore and alongshore dispersion
results in a nonlinear relation between alongshore dispersal
distance and larval planktonic period for dispersion in a
sheared flow. Thus, small changes in cross-shore dispersal,
whether due to environmental differences or larval behavior
result in significant differences in alongshore dispersal.
Finally, the interplay between advection and diffusion is
explored, showing the importance of adequately representing the
diffusive effects that mitigate alongshore advection. In most
cases, diffusion acts to prevent ?washout? of a population and
allows for more flexibility in the size and spacing of effective
marine reserves. Future challenges must bring oceanographers and
ecologists together around specific dispersal problems if there
is to be a significant improvement in the notable absence of
hard data in this field of enquiry.},

abstract = {The discussions in the Villefranche Workshop covered a wide range
of issues. The term regime shift was originally confined to
spatial or temporal correspondences between climatic indices and
population abundance. The body of evidence for
physical-biological coupling has certainly generated a much
better appreciation of the natural decadal scale variability in
marine systems. It is difficult, however, to deduce from these
time series, the mechanisms or trophic pathways that produce the
correspondence. Ideally, we would need experimental manipulations
such as those used in small lakes, to unravel the causal
connections. Since this is impossible in the open sea, we must
use comparisons between systems subject to different types of
perturbation or stress. We focused at the Workshop on the effects
of over-fishing in different marine regimes. The consequences of
large scale changes in community structure imposed by excessive
fishing give valuable case studies. Coral reefs, rocky shores,
freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems provide other examples. The
possible existence of similar processes across such diverse
systems raises corresponding questions about common ecological
principles. The adaptive benefits of maximizing resilience
(defined as minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the perturbed
system) were considered. The corollary of this assumption is
that, at the limits of adaptation, there will be switching
between communities, providing a potential ground for a broad
definition of regime shifts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

abstract = {Efforts to understand the population dynamics of marine species with planktonic larvae have been stymied by the fact that the larvae recruiting to a location have little chance of originating from that site. Patterns of,larval movement and the spatial scale of dispersal are expected to be major forces regulating the dynamics of marine populations and communities. Unfortunately, the scale and predictability of larval dispersal and its regulation by physical circulation remains unknown due largely to the impossibility of measuring dispersal in open marine environments. Here we exploit strong genetic differentiation among marine mussel populations in southwest England to measure larval dispersal among adjoining genetic patches. This approach allows estimates of larval dispersal over relatively great distances. We combine these measurements with results from a high-resolution model of coastal circulation to test the hypothesis that larval dispersal is regulated by physical circulation. We show that larval dispersal typically occurs over distances of similar to30 km but in some cases was at least 64 km. The circulation model accurately predicted general patterns of larval transport between genetic regions, the scale of larval dispersal, and genetic isolation created by physical barriers to circulation. We demonstrate that physical circulation models and genetic measures of larval transport can be coupled to assess the geographic scale of larval dispersal in marine environments.},

abstract = {Breakwaters dominate shorelines in many coastal urban areas, providing substantial hard-bottom habitat upon which diverse and abundant reef communities develop. In recognition of their potential ecological and economic importance, there is increasing interest in understanding how design features can influence community development. We investigated the influence of wave exposure on breakwater coral communities in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Coral community composition, cover, size structure, recruitment, mortality, and growth rates were compared quarterly between two windward and two leeward breakwater sites for 1 yr to explore the influence of wave exposure on coral community development. Comparisons also were made with a natural coral reef to gain an understanding of how community structure and dynamics compare between these habitats. Benthic and water column sediment particle sizes were also analyzed. Leeward breakwaters contained a low-cover coral community dominated by small colonies with high mortality compared with windward breakwaters and the natural reef. Windward breakwater coral communities had comparable recruitment, mortality, and growth rates as the natural reef. Fine sediments ({\&}{\#}60; 63 {\&}{\#}956;m) dominated the benthos and water column on leeward breakwaters, while windward breakwaters and the natural reef were dominated by sediments with larger size classes ({\&}{\#}62; 125 {\&}{\#}956;m), likely as a result of differences in wave action among reef types. Overall, these results suggest that leeward breakwaters represent sub-optimal habitats for coral community development. However, with appropriate design, breakwaters can develop diverse and abundant coral communities with comparable coral cover, demographics, and growth rates to those on the natural reef in Dubai.},

multivariate extension of weighted averaging ordination, which

measure this separation.As its name suggests, CCA is also a

visualizes not only a pattern of community variation (as in
standard ordination) but also the main features of the
distributions of species along the environmental variables.
Applications demonstrate that CCA can be used both for detecting
species-environment relations, and for investigating specific
questions about the response of species to environmental
variables. Questions in community ecology that have typically
been studied by `indirect' gradient analysis (i.e. ordination
followed by external interpretation of the axes) can now be
answered more directly by CCA.},

Although the photo- inhibition effects were partly attributable to protective mechanisms, a concurrent increase in minimal fluores- cence (Fo) indicated damage to Photosystem II reaction centers. The magnitude of photoinhibition was propor- tional to irradiance and duration; however, Fv/Fm was significantly reduced after exposure to irradiances as low as 40 to 50 gmol photons m-Zs- 1 for 1 h, or to 700 gmol photons m- 2s- {\~{}} for only 5 rain. In contrast, photosynthetic capacity (P .... ) was affected only at much higher irradiance. Superoptimal temperatures up to 24 {\~{}} did not exacerbate high-light effects. At 25 {\~{}} however, alpha and Pmax were more susceptible to photoinhibition than at lower temperatures. Recovery from photoinhibition was examined by following Fv/Fm and Fo for 24 h after exposure to high light. Recovery of F{\~{}}/F m was fastest during the first 1 to 3 h, and slowed or ceased after 6 to 12 h, while recovery of Fo was relatively constant over 12h. Dithiothreitol, which blocks formation of energy-dissipating xanthophylls, reduced both the initial rate and extent of recovery. Chloramphenicol, which blocks chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis, had little effect on initial rates of recovery, but stopped recovery after 3 h. Thus, L. sac- charina appears to rely on the xanthophyll cycle to protect the photosynthetic apparatus, and reversal of this protective mechanism causes the rapid initial re- covery in Fv/Fm. Longterm recovery depends on repair of damaged reaction centers. Both the rate and extent of recovery were temperature-dependent. The initial rate was higher at 18 to 22 {\~{}} than at 12 {\~{}} but the extent of recovery over 24 h declined with increasing temperature. High temperatures, therefore, appear to enhance protective mechanisms, but disrupt repair pro- cesses. L. saccharina from Long Island Sound, an eco- type adapted to low light and high temperature, showed slightly but consistently greater effects of photoinhibition than plants from the Atlantic coast of Maine, but exhibited faster recovery at superoptimal temperatures.},

abstract = {Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of cold- water rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodi- versity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40–60° latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2–3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the wide- spread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish-to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin popu- lations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large- scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.},

abstract = {The subtidal region at Cape Banks, New South Wales, Australia, is char- acterized by large areas covered solely by encrusting coralline algae in association with large densities of invertebrate grazers. Orthogonal removals of these grazers: the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii; the limpets Patelloida alticostata, P. mufria, and Cellana tra- moserica; and the turbinids Australium tentiforme and Turbo torquata, were done at two sites and two times to investigate the interactions among these species and their effects on the algal community. These manipulations had large effects on both the algal and animal communities, although the type and intensity of these interactions altered at different temporal and spatial scales. Initially, the removal of urchins and/or all species of limpets resulted in a rapid increase in the amount of noncrustose algae in these areas. Removal of turbinids, however, had no significant effect. Where both limpets and urchins had been removed, the cover of foliose algae continued to increase quickly and was :80-100{\%} after 12 mo. In areas where only urchins were removed, the increase in the cover of algae was slower, and only approached 100{\%} after 18-24 mo. Where only limpets had been removed, 3 mo after an initial increase in the cover of filamentous algae the cover declined to be only slightly more than in control areas. These results were similar at all sites and times. In one series of removals, the effects of some of the species of limpets were separated. In this case, the increase in the cover of algae was found to be fastest when only P. mufria was left (the urchins and other limpets removed), than when all limpets and urchins had been removed. Initially, the removal of the urchins generally resulted in a large increase in the re- cruitment and density of the limpets. Approximately 1 yr following the removal of the urchins, however, the density of adult and juvenile limpets of all species had declined to near zero. Removal of the larger species of limpets, P. alticostata and Cellana, also increased the rate of recruitment of the smaller species, P. mufria. Thus, these invertebrate grazers, especially the sea urchins, appeared to be necessary for the maintenance of the areas of crustose algae. Similarly, the sea urchins were found to be necessary for the continued presence of the limpets within these areas. The strong effects of the urchins on this community, and the application of the situation to theories concerning keystone species and facilitation, are discussed in relation to the important but more subtle effects of the limpets},

@article{Foster2010-dg,
abstract = {It is increasingly argued that human-induced alterations to food
webs have resulted in the degradation of coastal ecosystems and
even their ``collapse.'' We examined the evidence for this
argument for Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) forests in
southern California. Others have concluded that forests in this
region collapsed between 1950 and 1970 as a result of sea urchin
grazing driven by overfishing of sea urchin predators (sheephead
wrasse and spiny lobsters) and competitors (abalone), and that
the kelp forests recovered but are currently sustained as a
result of a commercial sea urchin fishery that began in the
early 1970s. Our examination of the historical record, primary
publications, and previously unpublished data showed that there
was no widespread decline in the region between 1950 and 1970,
but there were localised declines in mainland kelp forests near
the rapidly growing cities of Los Angeles and San Diego. The
preponderance of evidence indicates that kelp losses were caused
primarily by large increases in contaminated sewage discharged
into coastal waters, sedimentation from coastal development, and
the 1957-1959 El Ni??o. Increases in active sea urchin foraging
were most likely a secondary effect following dwindling food
resources. The forests recovered when sewage treatment improved
and sewage outfalls were relocated. The effects of fisheries
were explored by correlation analysis between kelp canopy cover
and commercial sea urchin landings, and among fisheries landings
for sea urchins, abalone, sheephead and lobster. These
correlations were generally insignificant, but were often
confounded by differences in the spatial scale over which the
data were collected as well as factors other than simple
abundance that affect the fisheries. However, where
area-specific data were available, the landings of sea urchins
generally tracked kelp abundance, most likely because roe
(gonad) development is directly related to food availability. A
literature review showed that although sheephead and lobsters
may control sea urchin abundance at small spatial scales within
some sites, there is little evidence they do so over large
areas. That abalone and sea urchins compete, such that sea
urchins increased as a result of abalone harvesting, is largely
conjecture based on their similar habitat and food utilization.
This study shows that kelp forests in southern California did
not collapse, and that declines in some coastal sites were
caused primarily by degradation of water quality, increased
sedimentation and contamination, and unfavorable oceanographic
conditions. We conclude that management by species' protection
or reserves will not be effective if poor habitat quality
impacts the ability of giant kelp to survive and thrive. ?? 2010

abstract = {We compared populations of Laminaria hyperborea from different regions along the Norwegian coast (58–71?N). The aim of the study was to examine possible regional differences in population demography and to relate these to latitudinal gradients in ambient temperature and light. A number of population parameters were examined in understory and canopy kelp individuals. We found latitudinal differences in stipe growth rate and growth pattern, mortality, lon- gevity, recruitment and density. Stipe growth rate was higher for young individuals in mid-Norway than in south and north Norway. Mean stipe length was related to temperature and light, and correlated significantly with indices combining temperature during the growth season and daylength in summer. Mortality decreased and longevity increased with increasing latitude, prob- ably because of a temperature decrease with increasing latitude and a general reduction in metabolic rate. Greater longevity may also cause the observed decrease in recruitment rate with increasing latitude, since there are fewer opportunities for understory individuals to replace dead canopy individuals. The development of particularly large kelp in mid-Norway appears to be explained by high growth rates and not a particularly long life span, as earlier assumed. This has consequences for decisions of the optimal harvesting regime for the species in the region, with regard to yield and mainte- nance of associated biodiversity. Communicated},

Conceptual issues include the widespread occurrence of transphyletic use of the same resources (space and food), theories and experimental analyses of intermediate disturbance in relation to numbers of species, the complex but pervasive nature of indirect interactions among species, relative importance of 'top-down' versus 'bottom-up' control of assemblages and the importance to rocky intertidal species of 'supply-side' influences on densities and interactions. Methodological advances include experimental designs for complex and patchy, interacting sets of species, the importance of controls in experimental manipulations and methods for analyses of hierarchical scales of patterns and processes.

abstract = {Tracing large-scale patterns of ecosystem distribution in land and marine environments is a fundamental task of field biology. The resulting patterns often have important implications in ecology, biogeography, and evolution as well as applied consequences in resource management and utilization. Classically, studies of marine ecosystems found at the sea edge, on hard substratum at levels down to 30--40 m, have distinguished three main ecological systems that replace each other at different latitudes. Coral reefs characterize lower latitudes and tropical waters (1), kelp forests replace coral reefs in most cold and temperate waters in both hemispheres (2, 3), whereas thickets of other large brown algae occupy the cold waters around Antarctica (4). Work by Graham et al. (5) included in a recent issue of PNAS changes dramatically this well accepted latitudinal pattern of marine ecosystem distribution. Using a diversity of data, Graham et al. first predicted the widespread occurrence of unexplored, submerged (30- to 200-m depth) kelp habitats in regions between the Tropic of Cancer (23.5$\backslash$,{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$circ{\}}N) and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5$\backslash$,{\^{}}{\{}$\backslash$circ{\}}S). Then, using deep-water SCUBA diving, they documented the presence of extensive kelp forests in eight localities within one of the predicted tropical regions. The emerging picture (Fig. 1A) is one of widespread occurrence of kelp forest formations in both surface and deep waters along most continents.},

abstract = {Assessing the vulnerability to storm surges requires amongst other things to identify the degree of coastal exposure to active waves. This paper proposes an integrated analytical approach that involves: 1) the degree of coastal exposure to different wave directions of incidence, 2) the extent of human structures at risk, and 3) the maximum wave height determination for each identified direction based on local wave climate analysis. It contributes to the development of a method for assessing vulnerability of existing built coastal assets to storm surge damages. Results provide a diagnostic of constructions' vulnerability, which is essential for adaptation and mitigation planning. This approachwas applied to beaches of SantaCatarina Island on the Brazilian southern coast. The northeast wave direction endangers most of the area due to the existing occupation pattern close to the sea toward that quadrant. Extreme events are more frequently associated with south and southeastwave directions. Integrating all variables, northeast wave direction was confirmed as the most dangerous in the area, followed by southern, eastern and southeastern directions, respectively. These results differ from usual estimations that tend to consider the most frequent wave directions and higher intensities, without considering the potentially affected developed surfaces.},

all floating material found on the surface of oceans and seas.
Notwithstanding the absence of natural rocky shores, ephemeral
floating seaweed clumps are frequently encountered along the
Belgian coast. From October 2002 to April 2003, seaweed samples
and control samples (i.e. surface water samples from a
seaweed-free area) were collected every other week. Multivariate
analysis on neustonic macrofaunal abundances showed significant
differences between seaweed and control samples in the fraction
{\textgreater}1 mm. Differences were less conspicuous in the 0.5–1 mm
fraction. Seaweed samples were characterised by the presence of
seaweed fauna e.g. Acari, Idotea baltica, Gammarus sp., while
control samples mainly contained Calanoida, Larvacea,
Chaetognatha, and planktonic larvae of crustaceans and
polychaetes. Seaweed samples (1 mm fraction) harboured
considerably higher diversities (×3), densities (×18) and
biomasses (×49) compared to the surrounding water column
(control samples). The impact of floating seaweeds on the
neustonic environment was quantified by the calculation of the
added values of seaweed samples considering biomass and density.
These calculations resulted in mean added values of 311 ind m−2
in density and 305 mg ADW m−2 in biomass. The association degree
per species was expressed as the mean percentage of individuals
found in seaweed samples in proportion to the total density and
biomass of that species (seaweed samples + control samples).
Thirteen species showed an association percentage {\textgreater}95{\%}, and can
therefore be considered members of the floating seaweed fauna.},

for understanding the environmental drivers of ecosystem
dynamics. We assessed the role of several environmental drivers
in explaining temporal and spatial patterns in the abundance of
giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in the Santa Barbara Channel
between 1984 and 2009. We developed a novel method for estimating
the canopy biomass of giant kelp from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper
satellite imagery, which allowed us to examine the dynamics of
giant-kelp biomass on spatial scales ranging from 100s of m 2 to
100s of km 2 and temporal scales ranging from several weeks to 25
yr. Comparisons of changes in canopy biomass with oceanographic
and climatic data revealed that winter losses of regional kelp
canopy biomass were positively correlated with significant wave
height (r 2 = 0.50), while spring recoveries were negatively
correlated with sea surface temperature (r 2 = 0.30; used as a
proxy for nutrient availability). On interannual timescales,
regional kelp-canopy biomass lagged the variations in wave
heights, sea surface temperatures, and the North Pacific Gyre
Oscillation index by 3 yr, indicating that these factors affect
cycles of kelp recruitment and mortality. Results from cluster
analysis showed that the response of kelp biomass to
environmental conditions varied among different subregions of the
Santa Barbara Channel. The dynamics of kelp biomass in exposed
regions were related to wave disturbance, while kelp dynamics in
sheltered regions tracked sea surface temperatures more closely.
These results depict a high level of regional heterogeneity in
the biomass dynamics of this important foundation species. ¬{\textcopyright}

This hypothesis has recently been countered with the proposal that the presence of surfactants in the gut fluids of herbivores may preclude the digestibility-reducing effects of plant polyphenols. We examined three marine isopods, three limpets, and a rock lobster, and established that surfactants are present in the digestive fluids of all of these organisms. However, further determinations of the efficacy with which these surfactants can prevent the complexation of proteins by brown-algal polyphenols in vitro revealed substantial differences between species. Moreover, in cases where the surfactants were ineffective, polyphenols reduced in vitro digestibility in a dose-dependent manner. We therefore conclude that the presence of gut surfactants does not necessarily preclude protein precipitation by polyphenols in vivo. Thus polyphenols might still be regarded as digestibility-reducing compounds, since gut surfactants only counter these effects in some cases.},

abstract = {The influence of wave-exposure on the growth and erosion rates of
Macrocystis pyrifera was determined in Paterson Inlet, Stewart
Island, New Zealand, for each season of 2002. During autumn,
following a period of low seawater nitrogen, sites that received
significant amounts of oscil- latory flow from waves exhibited
higher frond growth rates than at wave-sheltered sites. Blade and
stipe growth rates at wave-exposed sites were at a yearly maximum
during this period, and were 4.3 and 1.6 times higher
respectively than at wave-sheltered sites where growth was at a
yearly mini- mum. During this time C:N ratios and nitrogen
concentrations of blade tissues indicated that the nitrogen
status of frond apices, where the majority of growth occurs, was
greater at wave-exposed sites than at wave-sheltered sites.
During periods when kelp tissue nitrogen levels are low, but some
inorganic nitrogen is available in the water column, oscillatory
flow may enhance nutrient uptake by M. pyrifera by increasing the
flux of nutrients into kelp canopies and by reducing the size of
diffusion boundary layers at the kelp surface. Exposure to waves
also modified the seasonal pattern of M. pyrifera growth by
ameliorating the negative effect of low seawater nitrogen
concentrations during summer and autumn. Blade and stipe growth
was relatively steady at wave-exposed sites during the study
period, while wave-sheltered sites had distinct seasonal patterns
with low growth during summer and autumn, increasing through
winter to spring maxima. In this system, water motion influences
the growth rates of M. pyrifera only at specific times of year;
when tissue nitrogen levels are low but some inorganic nitrogen
is available in the water column.},

estimated by comparing our IBD slope with those from simulations

genetic distance to habitat variables included both geographic

The growth of individually tagged sea urchins in the populations was recorded at monthly intervals to determine seasonal growth patterns. Ages were determined by counting annually formed rings in their genital plates. The effect of tagging on annual growth rates of sea urchins was determined by comparing the sizes of tagged and untagged individuals of the same ages at the end of the study. Growth of tagged individuals was seasonal and their annual growth rates decreased with increasing size. Monthly growth rates of the tagged sea urchins were lowest in winter, highest in early spring, and declined sharply during late spring and early summer. Tagging did not significantly affect the growth of tagged compared to untagged individuals during the study. Regression of the sizes of tagged sea urchins after 1 year on their initial size suggested that the growth of this species does not conform well to commonly used growth models such as the von Bertalanffy equation.},

abstract = {Declines in coral cover are generally associated with increases
in the abundance of fleshy algae. In many cases, it remains
unclear whether algae are responsible, directly or indirectly,
for coral death or whether they simply settle on dead coral
surfaces. Here, we show that algae can indirectly cause coral
mortality by enhancing microbial activity via the release of
dissolved compounds. When coral and algae were placed in chambers
together but separated by a 0.02 mum filter, corals suffered
100{\%} mortality. With the addition of the broad-spectrum
antibiotic ampicillin, mortality was completely prevented.
Physiological measurements showed complementary patterns of
increasing coral stress with proximity to algae. Our results
suggest that as human impacts increase and algae become more
abundant on reefs a positive feedback loop may be created whereby
compounds released by algae enhance microbial activity on live
coral surfaces causing mortality of corals and further algal
growth.},

abstract = {Sedimentation and turbidity are significant contributors to
declines in populations of North American aquatic organisms.
Impacts to lotic fauna may be expressed through pervasive
alterations in local food chains beginning at the primary
trophic level. Decreases in primary production are associated
with increases in sedimentation and turbidity and produce
negative cascading effects through depleted food availability to
zooplankton, insects, freshwater mollusks, and fish. Direct
effects at each trophic level are mortality, reduced
physiological function, and avoidance; however, decreases in
available food at trophic levels also result in depressed rates
of growth, reproduction, and recruitment. Impacts of turbidity
to aquatic organisms often seem inconsistent among watersheds
and experiments, but this apparent difference is actually due to
the lack of correlation between suspended sediment
concentrations (mg/L) and units of measure (Nephelometric
Turbidity Units, NTU). The use of NTU as a surrogate measurement
of suspended sediment to predict biotic effects within
watersheds is dubious. Similar NTU measurements from different
watersheds may be correlated with different concentrations of
suspended sediment. For monitoring the effects of turbidity
within local watersheds, we recommend that the correlation
between suspended sediment and NTUs be examined over a range of
discharge recordings, and that this be used as a baseline to
examine local effects. We recommend that riparian buffer strips
and livestock fencing be used to reduce sediment input to
streams.},

an objective and automated method developed to simultaneously
determine both the structural properties and evolution

designed to monitor systems over the Amazon region, this method
has now been adapted for subtropical southern Africa. In this
paper, a detailed climatology of 70 mesoscale convective

over southern Africa during the 1998?2006 period are presented.
Most MCCs are clustered along the eastern regions of southern
Africa, adjacent to the warm waters of the Mozambique Channel
and Agulhas Current. A few infrequent systems are found to be
developing in Namibia and Botswana. The systems are found to
predominantly occur during the months of November?February, with
maximum activity occurring in November and December. The
transition from a more midlatitude-dominated circulation to a
tropical circulation over the region during the late summer
leads to an uncharacteristic equatorward migration of the MCC
distribution then. The analysis also suggests that there is
variability in MCC frequency on monthly and seasonal time
scales. Although fewer in number (about nine per season)
compared to MCC populations in other regions, the systems do
tend to follow the nocturnal life cycle as documented elsewhere.},

Under conditions expected in the 21st century, global warming and ocean acidification will compromise carbonate accretion, with corals becoming increasingly rare on reef systems. The result will be less diverse reef communities and carbonate reef structures that fail to be maintained. Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef-associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people.

Worldwide, these communities generally share susceptibility to destructive overgrazing by sea urchins. The impact of sea-urchin grazing is governed by the ratio between food availability and grazing pressure, thus factors affecting the abundance of both urchins and kelps are central to ecosystem integrity. Some kelp ecosystems share a second generality, the association of exploitation of various urchin predators with destructive levels of urchin grazing, leading to cascading implications for other species dependent on the productivity and habitat provided by the kelps. Competition between abalones and sea urchins also affects some kelp communities. These ecosystem-structuring processes are complicated by a variety of bottom-up and top-down factors, including variability in ocean climate affecting kelp productivity and recruitment of key species, and echinoid disease. Potential ecosystem effects of fisheries for predators, abalones, sea urchins, and kelps are reviewed biogeographically. Given the hundreds to thousands of years that many nearshore marine ecosystems have been exploited, no-take marine reserves may be the only way to determine the true ecosystem effects of fishing.},

The simpler methods fail in relating changes in vital rates with changes in population viability whereas more complex methods lack accuracy by neglecting interactions among vital rates. Point 2 The difference between the fitness (evaluated by the population growth rate.) of two alternative demographies is decomposed into the contributions of the differences between the pair-wised vital rates and their interactions. This is achieved through a full Taylor expansion (i.e. remainder = 0) of the demographic model. The significance of each term is determined by permutation tests under the null hypothesis that all demographies come from the same pool. Point 3 An example is given with periodic demographic matrices of the microscopic haploid phase of two kelp cryptic species observed to partition their niche occupation along the Chilean coast. The method provided clear and synthetic results showing conditional differentiation of reproduction is an important driver for their differences in fitness along the latitudinal temperature gradient. But it also demonstrated that interactions among vital rates cannot be neglected as they compose a significant part of the differences between demographies. Point 4 This method allows researchers to access the effects of multiple effective changes in a life-cycle from only two experiments. Evolutionists can determine with confidence the effective causes for changes in fitness whereas population managers can determine best strategies from simpler experimental designs.},

and ecologically important in tropical and subtropical marine
environments. It has been hypothesized that the abundance of
Halimeda on coral reefs is in part due to the ability of this
genus to propagate asexually via vegetative fragmentation.
However, vegetative fragmentation has only been documented for
H. discoidea in a laboratory setting. To test the hypothesis
that vegetative fragmentation contributes to field populations
of Halimeda, we examined three aspects of fragmentation by H.
tuna (Ellis and Solander) Lamouroux, H. opuntia (Linneaus)
Lamouroux and H. goreaui Taylor on Conch Reef in the Florida
Keys: (1) short-term (8 days) and long-term (14 weeks) fragment
survival and rhizoid production in the laboratory and field (7
and 21 m), (2) size of the fragment pool and (3) influences of
herbivory and water motion on production and dispersal of
fragments. Although morphologically similar to H. discoidea,
only a small percentage of H. tuna fragments survived. Fragments
of H. opuntia and H. goreaui were more robust, and survival and
rhizoid production were positively correlated with size in
short-term trials. In 14-week field trials, one-third or fewer
fragments of any species survived at 7 m, potentially because
fragments were covered by large amounts of sediment. Survivors
included some buried, seemingly dead individuals that turned
green when exposed to light, highlighting the remarkable ability
of this genus to survive disturbances. There was much less
sediment accumulation at 21 m, where more fragments survived.
Most (93{\%}) eight-segment fragments of H. opuntia produced
attachment rhizoids by the end of the 14-week trial. Overall, a
range of 4.7–9.4 fragments of Halimeda m−2 day−1 were found on
Conch Reef; most fragments were generated by H. goreaui. Fish
bite marks were evident on 75–85{\%} of the individuals of H. tuna
and the number of bites per thallus ranged from 1 to 23.
Herbivorous reef fish commonly fed on all three species of
Halimeda. Some fish consumed the biomass, while others rejected
most bites. For example, 83{\%} of bites were rejected by the
blue-striped grunt. Dispersal distances for rejected bites
ranged from 0 to 31 m. Water motion was also responsible for
fragment dispersal; experimentally produced fragments moved up
to 48 cm day−1. Results presented here suggest that asexual
propagation of fragments of Halimeda is an important component
of the life-history of this genus and vegetative fragmentation
contributes to the abundance of this genus on coral reefs.},

The distribution of recently settled juvenile snails coincides closely with adult distributions. in- dicat{\~{}}ng that planktonic larvae of the three species ma1 settle differential11 to different depths. Juveniles of the two abundant species occur in different microhabitats at the extremes of their adult ranges: juvenile Tegula brunrzea occur in the low-intertidal'shallow-subtidal zone on algae-covered rock substrate. and juvenile T. pullrgo occur in deep water (I 1-1 2 m) on shell-fragment rubble. T. rnontereyi juveniles are less abundant than those of the other two species: depth and microhabitat distributions are similar to those of T. pullrgo. Competition among the three species is not strong: neither food nor space limitation appears to occur in nature. The effects of competition on patterns of movement and habitat use in the field and on growth and reproductive development in the laboratory showed that interspecific and intraspecific effects were not significantly different. In addition. densities at which competition would have a strong effect are probabl{\~{}} much higher than those that occur naturall{\~{}}. It is unlikely that competition is responsible for the bathymetric segregation of the three species. The major predators of Tegula are benthic invertebrates and demersal fishes. Tegula have two spatial refuges from predators: kelp plants (which allow snails to stay off the primary substratum and away from predators) and dense benthic vegetation (predators cannot detect and capture snails as easily in areas of dense vegetation). Benthic predation pressure increases with increasing substrate depth because (I) the cover of protective benthic vegetation decreases significantly. and (2)predators are more abundant in deeper water. Higher predation pressure in deeper water limits adult Tegula hrunnea to shallower depths. In- dividual T. bruunea spend more time on the kelp forest floor than do individuals of the other two species. causing them to be killed at a disproportionate11 higher rate in deeper water. Benthic predation is also responsible for the concentration of T. pulligo on kelp plants in deeper depths. but cannot explain why this species is not more abundant in shallow depths. The rarity of T. rpzontereyr is not caused by predation. since this species is the best defended of the three against starfish. For both species. patterns and intensities of larval settlement may be of primary importance. Further information on the larval biology of these species is needed.},

abstract = {Experimental physical disturbances on the assemblages of understorey species living in sublittoral kelp forests in central New South Wales were examined across several spatial and temporal scales. Experimental clearing of kelp canopies (mimicking damage done during storms) and subsequent macro- and microscopic sampling of cleared areas, edges of clearings and uncleared, control areas of natural kelp forest were done over a 14-month period across several spatial scales: three replicate patches of clearings and controls (3-5 m apart) in each of two sites (10-20 m apart) in each of two kelp forests (0.2-5 km apart) in each of four locations (20-140 km apart). Despite large variations in abundances and temporal fluctuations, there were some similarities in responses to disturbance by several taxa in most locations. The covers of holdfasts of Ecklonia radiata and encrusting algae decreased in the centres of most clearings in most kelp forests as plots became overgrown, first by microscopic filamentous algae and then by macroscopic foliose algae. While these changes occurred, a layer of sediment increased in cover in clearings and the species richness of the assemblage declined. Assemblages on the edges of clearings often showed effects intermediate between those in the centres of clearings and those under the natural canopy. In some forests, juveniles of Ecklonia radiata recruited, but this tended to occur toward the edges of clearings where the covers of microalgae, turf and sediment were least. The presence of turfing species in the centres of clearings also seemed to preclude the successful establishment of some sponges and an ascidian during their periods of recruitment. The microscopic and turfing algae which colonized clearings were different in different places, as were the periods after clearing before they colonized. Species that were fairly uniform in their responses to disturbance were common, occurring in similar abundances in most places. Temporal variability showed that some fluctuations occurred over a matter of weeks (e.g. the microscopic organisms), others occurred over several months (foliose algae), whilst the largest time-scale involved the recovery of the disturbed kelp canopy over the full duration of the experiment. Despite significant small-scale spatial patchiness in the responses of taxa to disturbances, these effects were fairly consistent within a particular forest. The results are discussed in terms of current theories of patch dynamics, as they apply to our understanding of kelp systems. ?? 1993.},

ecosystems regarding biodiversity and energy flow. A large
proportion of macrophyte species can be characterised as
ecosystem engineers—organisms that directly or indirectly affect
the availability of resources to other species by modifying,
maintaining, and creating habitats. This book is divided into
three main themes: • Marine macroalgae and seagrasses as sources
of biodiversity gives an overview of the diversity of the main
organisms associated with macrophytes, and their functional role
and interactions within their hosts. • Primary and secondary
production of Macrophytes synthesizes research on food web
structures derived from/or associated with, macrophytes and the
transfer of macrophytic primary and secondary production from
one ecosystem to another. • Threats to macrophytic ecosystem
engineers addresses human-induced effects including
eutrophication, physical destruction, invasive species, and
global warming. The book is among the first one to concentrate
on the value of macrophytes for the well-being of marine
habitats. The book is aimed at academics but may be useful for
students, policy makers, and laymen alike.},

abstract = {Regulations of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game require that all fisheries in the state have a harvest management plan. In southeast Alaska two species of floating kelps, Nereocystis luetkeana and Alaria fistulosa, have been commercially harvested since 1992 for use as agrochemicals by the Alaska Kelp Company. However, there is currently no harvest management plan for this fishery. The lack of a formalized management plan is one factor that has kept the kelp industry from expanding in the state. We have employed an aerial digital multispectral imaging system (DMSC) calibrated with ground truthing for performing such an assessment. The system can be flown at varying altitudes to achieve spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 2 m. Rapid ground truthing techniques were developed using morphometric measurements to predict biomass. Analysis of the DMSC imagery showed that good correlations could be developed between the multispectral imagery and kelp biomass estimates collected at the ground-truth sites. Repeatable estimates of kelp bed area derived from the multispectral imagery could be made at varying tidal levels. However, broad scale maps of kelp biomass suitable for estimating harvest rates could not be made at different tide levels. Multispectral imagery suitable for this purpose must be collected at a standard tidal level.},

by as much as 45°. Drifter data from an experiment conducted by

abstract = {Long-distance oceanic rafting is frequently invoked as an
explanation for broad geo- graphic distributions of sedentary
marine taxa, but evidence for this ecological process remains
elusive. We explored empirically the potential of rafting as a
dispersal mechanism by comparing cir- cumpolar mtDNA variability
in 3 codistributed subantarctic taxa: 2 direct-developing
epifaunal crustacean species (Limnoria stephenseni, Parawaldeckia
kidderi) and their macroalgal host (Durvil- laea antarctica). A
previous study of D. antarctica suggests that its subantarctic
populations were established only postglacially, and we predict
that the epifaunal invertebrates associated with it experienced a
parallel island-colonization episode, facilitated by
kelp-rafting. We generated and analysed mtDNA sequence data
(cytochrome oxidase subunit I [COI] gene, {\textgreater}900 base pairs) from
89 L. stephenseni and 62 P. kidderi specimens and reanalysed
previously published comparable data for D. antarctica. Both
epifaunal species exhibited wide-scale circumpolar distributions
of a single hap- lotype. Little sequence diversity was found
within island samples, with the exception of P. kidderi in the
Falkland Islands. The phylogeographic diversity and structuring
of the invertebrates was very similar to that of their kelp host
and consistent with a scenario of subantarctic recolonization and
pop- ulation expansion. The dependence of these otherwise
non-dispersive crustaceans on macroalgal holdfasts for food and
habitat, as well as the great abundance of D. antarctica adrift
in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), support rafting as
their most plausible recolonization mechanism. We suggest that
macroalgal rafting may explain similarities in the species
composition of intertidal marine communities across the
subantarctic.},

With the use of spatial databases, GIS, and available information about the value of rocky-shore communities as indicators of water quality, it is possible to obtain an environmental quality index representative of the ecological status of rocky coasts. This index, which completely fulfils the requirements of the WFD, is expressed as a ratio between the observed values in the sector of shore that is being assessed and the expected value in a reference condition zone with the same substrate and coastal morphology (Ecological Quality Ratio, EQR).

Individuals with increased flexibility and decreased strength were more likely to survive the duration of our study, although this effect was more pronounced in individuals with smaller holdfasts. Increased frond strength was also associated with a reduction in self-thinning, potentially explaining the observed increase in whole-plant mortality with increasing frond strength. * Results from this study demonstrate that variation in tissue mechanical properties among conspecifics can influence survivorship and this may have important evolutionary implications.},

This focus overlooks the direct effects of CO(2) on non-calcareous taxa, particularly those that play critical roles in ecosystem shifts. We used two experiments to investigate whether increased CO(2) could exacerbate kelp loss by facilitating non-calcareous algae that, we hypothesized, (i) inhibit the recovery of kelp forests on an urbanized coast, and (ii) form more extensive covers and greater biomass under moderate future CO(2) and associated temperature increases. Our experimental removal of turfs from a phase-shifted system (i.e. kelp- to turf-dominated) revealed that the number of kelp recruits increased, thereby indicating that turfs can inhibit kelp recruitment. Future CO(2) and temperature interacted synergistically to have a positive effect on the abundance of algal turfs, whereby they had twice the biomass and occupied over four times more available space than under current conditions. We suggest that the current preoccupation with the negative effects of ocean acidification on marine calcifiers overlooks potentially profound effects of increasing CO(2) and temperature on non-calcifying organisms.},

abstract = {Observations in the Gulf of Maine, USA, were used to characterize
the freshwater transport, temporal variability and dynamics of
the western Maine coastal current. These observations included
moored measurements, multiple hydrographic surveys, and drifter
releases during April-July of 1993 and 1994. There is a strong
seasonal signal in salinity and along-shore velocity of the
coastal current, caused by the freshwater inputs of the rivers
entering the western Gulf. Surface salinity within the coastal
current during the spring freshet is typically 2psu below
ambient, and along-shore currents in the surface layer are
directed southwestward at speeds of 0.10-0.20ms-1, occasionally
reaching 0.50ms-1. The plume thickness is typically 10-20m in
water depths of 50-100m, thus it is well isolated from the bottom
over most of its areal extent. The along-coast freshwater
transport within the plume varies considerably due to variations
in wind stress, but on time scales of weeks to months it follows
the variations of riverine input, with a time lag consistent with
the advective velocity. Less than half of the transport of the
coastal current is explained by the baroclinic gradient; the
barotropic forcing associated with the larger-scale dynamics of
the Gulf of Maine accounts for about 60{\%} of the transport. The
volume of freshwater transport in the coastal current exceeds the
local riverine input of fresh water by 30{\%}, suggesting a
significant contribution of freshwater transport from the St.
John River, 500km northeastward. The measurements within the
western Maine coastal current, however, indicate a significant
decrease in the baroclinic transport of fresh water along the
coast, with an e-folding scale of approximately 200km. {\textcopyright} 2004

abstract = {Evidence for long-term natural change in coastal ecosystems has to be separated from the effects of intense anthropogenic impacts, especially in heavily populated areas. The kelp forests of southern California, highly productive ecosystems organized around the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, support a variety of fisheries, and the kelp is harvested for extraction of alginates. Because of the importance of Macrocystis itself to the diverse assemblage within the kelp forest community, research in this ecosystem has focused on changes in giant kelp populations. Canopy maps of the Point Loma kelp forest near San Diego illustrate major changes over the last century; these changes have been ascribed to a variety of different causes, including temperature. To understand the role of physical forcing on interannual variability in the Macrocystis canopy at Point Loma, we compared two 31-year kelp data sets with available physical records. Annual average surface temperature was significantly correlated with kelp harvest, but explained only 24{\%} of the variance. Because the canopy of giant kelp is susceptible to disturbances that may not affect plant survival, we evaluated two subsurface measures-stipe number as an index of individual plant growth, and stipe density as a measure of carrying capacity. Both stipe measures were sensitive to interannual variability in surface temperature for the period 1983-95 and were more sensitive than plant survival. Plant size and carrying capacity were very low following 1992-93 El Nino conditions and the anomalously warm 1994. Comparison with historical stipe data from 1957, 1973, and 1974 indicates up to two-thirds reductions in standing biomass since 1957. There is a strong inverse trend between median plant size and the sums of anomalies in Scripps Institution of Oceanography Pier surface temperature, calculated quarterly for three years. It appears, however, that these large, interdecadal changes in biomass can be explained by the location of the data sets within multiyear warm and cold periods. We conclude that stipe numbers and stipe density-measures of individual plant size and carrying capacity-are useful tools for evaluating long-term change in Macrocystis populations within specific locations. Although limited by the paucity of historical observations, the sensitivity of stipe counts to surface temperature argues strongly for their incorporation into ongoing and future kelp forest research.},

is a dominant habitat-former and as such has a strong structuring
effect on associated algal assemblages. Morphological variation
in E. radiata potentially affects its interactions with the
surroundings and contributes to confusion about its taxonomy. We
quantified the magnitude of morphological variation in fully
developed E. radiata sporophytes across Australasia and tested
the hypotheses that E. radiata has different morphology at
different locations and that the degree of morphological
difference depends on spatial distances among locations. A total
of 11 morphological characters were sampled from 11 locations
along the Australian coastline from Kalbarri in Western Australia
to Sydney in New South Wales as well as from Doubtful Sound, New
Zealand. Most morphological characters varied considerably from
one location to another. For example, the average (±SE) thallus
length was 135.2±12.5 cm in Kalbarri and only 69.7±5.5 cm in
Sydney. There were no consistent spatial patterns of variation
among individual morphological characters, and, generally,
variations among individual characters were poorly correlated
(−0.5{\textless}R{\textless}0.5). This suggests that individual morphological
characters develop independently of each other in response to
processes operating at different spatial scales. Multivariate
measures of morphology were found to be different among some
locations and similar among others (−0.37≤Clarke's R≤1), but
there was no correlation (Spearman's R=0.08) between
morphological similarity and distance between locations.
Consequently, our results do not support clinal variation in E.
radiata morphology. Rather, they suggest the presence of discrete
morphologically different populations, in which the morphology at
any one location reflects multiple forcing factors operating on
different morphological characters at different spatial scales.},

Morphologically, Seacliff plants resembled those in California
more closely than those in the other New Zealand populations. The
relative growth rate in length of stipe internodes decreased
linearly with the logarithm of the distance from the apex, but
was less closely related to node number. Extrapolation gave zero

apparently unrelated to frond length, would be a useful measure
of activity over short time-periods. The relative growth rate in
lamina area (and prob-ably volume), while also related to
distance from the apex, showed a very different pattern,
increasing slightly to a peak at 100 to 200ram and declining to
nil by 1 m at Aquarium Point and 2 m in California. Maximal
lamina size was maintained for only 10 to 15 nodes at Aquarium
Point. Calculated node initiation frequencies were 2.7 d at
Papanui Inlet, 2 d at Aquarium Point, and 1 d in Cali-fornia. At
the latter sites it took about 2 mo for laminae and 2Y2 mo for
stipe internodes to mature. Deduced rela-tive growth rates in
stipe tissue and pneumatocyst fresh weight decreased from 0.24
(loge units per day) at the apex to 0.11 at 200 mm, where basal
lamina tissue had a rate of 0.29, a doubting in just over 2 d.
The production of tissue per frond was estimated as 25 and 36 g
fresh wt d -1 at Aquarium Point and in California, respectively.},

apparently non-dispersive coastal taxa that nonetheless have

broad-scale phylogeographic study to test whether two widespread
Southern Hemisphere species of non-buoyant littoral macroalgae
are capable of long-distance dispersal. Samples were collected
from along the coasts of southern Chile, New Zealand and several
subAntarctic islands, with the focus on high latitude
populations in the path of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current or
West Wind Drift. We targeted two widespread littoral macroalgal

Heterokontophyta) and the red alga Bostrychiaintricata
(Ceramiales, Rhodophyta). Phylogenetic analyses were performed
using partial mitochondrial (COI), chloroplast (rbcL) and
ribosomal nuclear (LSU / 28S) DNA sequence data. Numerous
deeply-divergent clades were resolved across all markers in each
of the target species, but close phylogenetic relationships -
even shared haplotypes - were observed among some populations
separated by large oceanic distances. Despite not being
particularly buoyant, both Adenocystisutricularis and
Bostrychiaintricata thus show genetic signatures of recent
dispersal across vast oceanic distances, presumably by
attachment to floating substrata such as wood or buoyant
macroalgae.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional numerical model of coastal flow, in which the
eddy fluxes are computed by a second-order turbulence model, has
been developed. The behaviour of the inertial oscillations due
to an impulsive start is in excellent agreement with the
analytical solution of Kunduet al. (Deep-Sea Research, 30,
1059–1082, 1983). Much of the inertial energy gain in the deep
ocean is due to the downward leakage from the coast-surface
corner and is accompanied by an upward phase propagation. The
low-frequency upwelling solutions develop gravitationally
unstable regions in the surface layer, even in the presence of
realistic surface heating. But the thickness of the surface
layer without surface cooling is never very large, so the
analytical models driven by a sink at the coast-surface corner
give realistic subsurface solutions. The upwelling solutions
generate flow reversal across a strong thermocline, but no
`closed' double cells. Frictional turning, as suggested by
several workers, is responsible for the flow reversal. These
open double cell persist in the presence of surface heating but
not in the presence of an alongshore pressure gradient, p$\gamma$ =
$\tau$$\gamma$(maximum depth). The imposition of p$\gamma$ creates a poleward
undercurrent on a flat shelf but not on a sloping shelf. The
alongshore jet moves offshore due to the nonlinear advection of
the thermocline, so that the width of the jet is larger than the
Rossby radius. An approximate expression has been derived for
predicting the offshore frontal location; the numerical
calculation is in fair agreement with it.},

abstract = {This study was designed to see if the intensity and location of
upwelling in the Benguela Current Upwelling System off Namibia
changed significantly during the last 70,000 years. Most of the
analytical work focused on geochemical, micropalaeontological
and stable isotopic analyses of a 6.5m long combined pilot and
piston core, PGPC12, from 1017m on the continental slope close
to Walvis Bay. The slope sediments are rich in organic matter.
Most of it is thought to represent deposition beneath a
productive shelf edge upwelling system, but some is supplied by
downslope nearbottom flow of material probably resuspended on
the outer continental shelf. Temporal changes in upwelling
intensity as represented by fluctuations in the accumulation of
organic matter do not show the simple `classical' pattern of
less upwelling and lower productivity in interglacials and more
upwelling and higher productivity in glacials, but instead show
a pattern of higher frequency fluctuations. The broad changes in
organic carbon accumulation reach maxima at times when the
earth-sun distance was greatest, indicating that this
accumulation responded to changes in the precession index; at
these times monsoons would have been weakest and Trade Winds
strongest. Maximum accumulation of organic matter on the slope
occurred in the last interstadial (isotope stage 3), and
coincided with coldest sea surface temperatures as recorded by
alkenone data (Uk37), and by nannofossil assemblages. It is
attributed largely to increased productivity in situ, rather
than the lateral supply of material eroded from older organic
rich deposits exposed by the lowering of sealevel at that time.
The enhanced productivity is attributed to a strengthening of
upwelling-favourable winds in this area in response to the
minimal solar insolation typical of this period. Diatoms
generally are not abundant in these sediments, so appear to be
unreliable indicators of productivity over the continental
slope. When sealevel was lowest (isotope stages 2 and 4) organic
matter previously deposited on the continental shelf was eroded
and dumped on the continental slope; this reworked material
constitutes up to 43{\%} of the flux of organic matter to the
slope at these times. This process did not affect the slope in
stage 3, when sealevel fell by only 50m. The accumulation of
terrigenous material was highest in stages 2 and 4. The
available data suggest that the terrigenous influx at those
times was primarily aeolian. We interpret this to mean that more
of the winds then came from the east (`Berg' winds), bringing an
influx of aeolian dust from the hinterland; these easterlies
were less favourable for upwelling than were the more southerly
Trade Winds that dominated during stage 3. Carbonate
accumulation was least in stages 2 and 4, largely in response to
dissolution induced by CO2-rich bottom waters.},

generalisation is relevant to oligotrophic marine systems. We
sampled three beaches with high and three beaches with low

wrack influences the abundance of macroinvertebrates; (2) wrack
acts as a food source for beach macroinvertebrates; and (3) the
influence of wrack varies between zones above the high water
mark. We measured wrack volume and composition, sediment
characteristics, the abundance of different epibenthic and
infaunal macroinvertebrates taxa, and $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N of
macrophytes and macroinvertebrates. The mean volume of wrack on
high-wrack beaches was 0.27-1.07 m3wrack m-2compared to 0.00-0.09
m3wrack m-2on low-wrack beaches. There were no significant
differences in sediment grain size, moisture content or loss on
ignition between the two types of beaches or zones. Epibenthic
fauna and infauna were consistently abundant on high-wrack
beaches (20-291 and 0.5-3.5 individuals 0.64 m-2, respectively),
but either absent or extremely rare in low-wrack beaches (0-3 and
0-0.1 individuals 0.64 m-2, respectively). Within high-wrack
beaches, there were no significant differences in the abundance
of epifauna or infauna among beaches or between zones. The $\delta$13C
values of macroinvertebrates at all sites were most similar to
red and brown algae, with the exception of beetles from two
beaches, which were closest to seagrasses. Mixing model
(Isosource) results for mesograzing amphipods and dipteran flies
suggested carbon was assimilated mostly from the seagrass
Posidonia spp., the dune grass Spinifex longifolia and red algae
for amphipods and from brown algae, red algae and dune vegetation
for dipteran flies. We conclude that the presence of
marine-derived wrack plays a major role in subsidising production
of macroinvertebrates on beaches of south-western Australia. We
suggest that marine subsidies can play a role in supporting
terrestrial production, even in oligotrophic marine environments.

abstract = {Strong top-down control by consumers has been demonstrated in rocky intertidal communities around the world. In contrast, the role of bottom-up effects (nutrients and productivity), known to have important influences in terrestrial and particularly freshwater ecosystems, is poorly known in marine hard-bottom communities. Recent studies in South Africa, New England, Oregon and New Zealand suggest that bottom-up processes can have important effects on rocky intertidal community structure. A significant aspect of all of these studies was the incorporation of processes varying on larger spatial scales than previously considered (10's to 1000's of km). In all four regions, variation in oceanographic factors (currents, upwelling, nutrients, rates of particle flux) was associated with different magnitudes of algal and/or phytoplankton abundance, availability of particulate food, and rates of recruitment. These processes led to differences in prey abundance and growth, secondary production, consumer growth, and consumer impact on prey resources. Oceanographic conditions therefore may vary on scales that generate ecologically significant variability in populations at the bottom of the food chain, and through upward-flowing food chain effects, lead to variation in top-down trophic effects. I conclude that top-down and bottom-up processes can be important joint determinants of community structure in rocky intertidal habitats, and predict that such effects will occur generally wherever oceanographic 'discontinuities' lie adjacent to rocky coastlines. I further argue that increased attention by researchers and of funding agencies to such benthic-pelagic coupling would dramatically enhance our understanding of the dynamics of marine ecosystems.

results are compared with buoy observations and NASA Scanning
Radar Altimeter (SRA) data, which were obtained on 24 August
1998 in the open ocean and on 26 August when the storm was
approaching the shore. The simulated significant wave height in
the open ocean reached 14 m, agreeing well with the SRA and buoy

the shore. In the open ocean, the dominant wavelength and wave
direction in all four quadrants relative to the storm center

the simulated dominant wavelength displays noticeable
overestimation because the wave model cannot properly simulate
shoaling processes. Direct comparison of the model and SRA
directional spectra in all four quadrants of the hurricane shows
excellent agreement in general. In some cases, the model
produces smoother spectra with narrower directional spreading
than do the observations. The spatial characteristics of the
spectra depend on the relative position from the hurricane
center, the hurricane translation speed, and bathymetry.
Attempts are made to provide simple explanations for the

Southern and northern Namibia had a greater horizontal spread on the primary axis of the DCA analysis, reflecting their greater habitat availability and heterogeneity. The shores of central Namibia, in contrast, exhibit minimal variation between shores. The difference between southern and central Namibia is an ecological shift brought about by an increase in temperature in the northern regions and a relatively high degree of sand inundation. The latter has result- ed in the dominance of sand-tolerant species. As a result, the sub-province is an ecological entity rather than a floristic one.},

The effects of fishing are examined at the single-species level and through trophic interactions. We summarize the status of chondrichthyan fisheries from around the world. Some 50{\%} of the estimated global catch of chondrichthyans is taken as by-catch, does not appear in official fishery statistics, and is almost totally unmanaged. When taken as by-catch, they are often subjected to high fishing mortality directed at teleost target species. Consequently, some skates, sawfish, and deep-water dogfish have been virtually extirpated From large regions. Some chondrichthyans are more resilient to fishing and we examine predictions on the vulnerability of different species based on their life-history and population parameters. At the species level, fishing may alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes in species abundance. We review the evidence for such density-dependent change. Fishing can affect trophic interactions and we examine cases of apparent species replacement and shifts in community composition. Sharks and rays learn to associate trawlers with food and feeding on discards may increase their populations. Using ECOSIM, we make some predictions about the long-term response of ecosystems to fishing on sharks. Three different environments are analysed: a tropical shelf ecosystem in Venezuela, a Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem, and a North Pacific oceanic ecosystem.

abstract = {Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living},
annote = {Much of the past research has focused on temperature and its relationship with organisms and their distributions and physiological functioning. However these simplistic relationships are not able to predict future climate scenarios; there are many aspects that may affect species. Temperature is is only one aspect. 

Warming trends are expected to be stronger over continental interiors than over oceans = increase in intensity of wind fields which may lead to an increase in nutrient availability at the surface. However deepening of the thermocline and stronger thermal stratification may prevent upwelling in future scenarios. 

Chemically - driven changes

{\textgreater} Rise in CO2 = drop in pH of the oceans
{\textgreater} decrease in pH will lead to changes in saturation horizons of aragonite, calcite, and other minerals important for calcifying organisms.
{\textgreater} CO2 will also deplete ozone layer = increase in ultra violate radiation

Ecological responses to climate change

{\textgreater} Direct effects = impacts on organisms performance in life history stages, physiological, morphological, and behavioral
{\textgreater} Population level = changes in transport processes that influence dispersal and recruitment 
{\textgreater} Community level (mediated by interacting species) = changes in abundance and per capita interaction strength of interacting species.

All of the above affect species distributions, biodiversity, productivity and micro-evolutionary processes.

Responses to: Temperature 

{\textgreater} Affects physiological processes
{\textgreater} Performance and survival
{\textgreater} Affects certain ontogenetic stages differently
{\textgreater} Can also affect the timing of ontogenetic processes
{\textgreater} Community level changes

Sea level Rise

{\textgreater} Upward shift in species distributions; Most species are expected to keep up with predicted changes, however slow growing and long lived organisms may be more vulnerable
{\textgreater} Decrease in habitat availability eg: intertidal habitat may be reduced by 20-70{\%} over the next 100 years in North American Bays. 

Changes in Circulation

{\textgreater} Increase in storms will lead to an increase in hydrodynamic disturbance, furthermore an increase in storm frequency may reduce the odds of recovery
{\textgreater} Possible shifts in nutrient supply
{\textgreater} Shifts in oceanographic patterns

CO2 and pH change

{\textgreater} Terrestial systems may be positively impacted by the increase in CO2, however marine plants (except Seagrams) are carbon saturated and therefore enhanced growth rates are not expected.
{\textgreater} Rise in CO2 has significant implications for physiolgical processes in marine organisms.
{\textgreater} Impacts may be disproportional among taxa

UV change

{\textgreater} Increase in UV 
{\textgreater} May affect invert rate larvae and algae 

Emergent ecological responses

{\textgreater} Zonation patterns are most likely going to shift
{\textgreater} Biogeographical range shifts will occur; there are contemporary examples of this
{\textgreater} Most species are expected to shift polewards (evidence of past relationship in fossil record) 

Changes in species composition, diversity and community structure

{\textgreater} Exploitation, habitat destruction/alteration and pollution is reducing the abundance of many marine species and increasing the likelihood of local extinctions (however no extinctions have been directly attributed to climate change) 
{\textgreater} Some marine systems have low functional diversity; I.e the loss of even one species can cause a important community and ecosystem consequences.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We experimentally investigated the response of
phytoplankton and understory macroalgae to canopies of giant
kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, by following changes in their biomass
and net primary production over 17 months in 600-m2 plots where
giant kelp was continually removed or left intact and allowed to
vary naturally. Production by phytoplankton was two times greater
and understory algae five times greater where Macrocystis was
removed relative to the intact forest. Understory biomass, but
not phytoplankton biomass, was suppressed inside the forest,
leading to a higher magnitude of effect on net primary production
(NPP) by understory relative to phytoplankton. Following a
natural decline of the Macrocystis canopy by winter storms,
understory macroalgae and phytoplankton increased production in
the Macrocystis control plot. This response was delayed for both
groups, with phytoplankton production increasing in spring and
understory increasing later during summer. The longer delay for
understory macroalgae was likely due to restrictions in the
timing of macroalgal recruitment and their slower growth rates
compared with phytoplankton and with increased competition for
light resulting from greater light absorption by the spring
phytoplankton bloom. Surprisingly, total ecosystem production
that included NPP by Macrocystis, phytoplankton, and understory
algae did not differ between the Macrocystis control and removal
plots for much of the study. NPP by understory algae, which
comprised the bulk of the ecosystem NPP in the Macrocystis
removal plot, can compensate to varying degrees for the loss of
Macrocystis production following its removal by winter storms.},

abstract = {At the end of the summer, drifting filamentous red algae cover
shallow bottoms and accumulate in huge cast walls on the open
shores of the non-tidal central Baltic Sea. The hypotheses that
beach cleaning increases water clarity, decreases the organic
content of the sand, and increases the species diversity in the
shallow zone closest to the shore, were tested through field
investigations and experiments. Cleaned shorelines were compared
with un-cleaned shorelines at two sites with different intensity
of beach cleaning in a rural area of SE Sweden. The results show
that water clarity was significantly increased off the
intensively cleaned beach but not off the moderately cleaned one.
Similarly, the total leakage of nitrogenous compounds decreased
off the intensively cleaned beach, but not off the moderately
cleaned. The organic content of the sand was lower on both
cleaned beaches compared with nearby uncleaned beaches. The total
animal biomass was significantly lower on the intensively cleaned
beach compared with the un-cleaned beach, but the moderately
cleaned beach gave no such effect. The difference in biodiversity
and community structure between cleaned and un-cleaned beaches
was insignificant. The most obvious difference in species
composition was a much higher number of planktivore opossum
shrimps of the genus Mysis and Praunus on the un-cleaned beaches.
The bacterial production and the amount of ciliates larger than
20 mm were also higher on un-cleaned beaches, indicating that the
microbial food web off the un-cleaned beaches is stimulated by
the discharge of decomposing algal material. The conclusion of
the study is that mechanical cleaning reduces the organic content
of the beach sand and may change the water quality and microbial
production, but the effect on the macrofaunal biodiversity is
insignificant. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

such as bivalves, sea urchins, and foraminifers, has led to
efforts to understand the controls on pH in their habitats,

of these habitats can lead to diel fluctuation in pH with
increases during the day and declines at night, suggesting no
net effect on pH at time scales longer than daily. We examined
the capacity of subarctic and Arctic kelps to up-regulate pH in
situ and experimentally tested the role of photoperiod in
determining the capacity of Arctic macrophytes to up-regulate
pH. Field observations at photoperiods of 15 and 24 hours in
Greenland combined with experimental manipulations of
photoperiod show that photoperiods longer than 21 hours,
characteristic of Arctic summers, are conducive to sustained
up-regulation of pH by kelp photosynthesis. We report a gradual
increase in pH of 0.15 units and a parallel decline in pCO2 of
100 parts per million over a 10-day period in an Arctic kelp
forest over midsummer, with ample scope for continued pH
increase during the months of continuous daylight. Experimental
increase in CO2 concentration further stimulated the capacity of
macrophytes to deplete CO2 and increase pH. We conclude that
long photoperiods in Arctic summers support sustained
up-regulation of pH in kelp forests, with potential benefits for
calcifiers, and propose that this mechanism may increase with
the projected expansion of Arctic vegetation in response to
warming and loss of sea ice.},

Location South Africa – the south coast between Cape Agulhas and the Eastern Cape/Kwazulu-Natal border, and eight MPAs within that area. Methods We used interpolated seaweed distribution records from all available sources, in 50-km coastal sections. Cluster analysis (Jaccard Average Linkage) of species presence/absence data provided measures of similarity between coastal sections and between MPAs. Complementarity analyses identified the sequence of ‘importance' of sections/MPAs for conserving seaweed species. Results Species presence/absence data indicated two main groups, representing western (cooler water) and eastern (warmer water) biogeographical divisions, as well as several biogeographical subdivisions within each of these groups. Complementarity analysis yielded a sequence of ‘importance' of coastal sections (in terms of the highest number of species included) that began with a section just east of central in the Agulhas Marine Province, around Port Alfred, where there is no MPA. This was followed by the easternmost section (warmest water), which contains the Pondoland MPA, and then by the westernmost (coolest water) section, containing the De Hoop MPA. Similar analysis of the actual species collected in MPAs showed a generally similar pattern. Main conclusions Seven current MPAs and one proposed coastal MPA in the Agulhas Marine Province appear to be well distributed and well sited to include (conserve) the full biogeographical range of seaweeds. However, if further MPAs are to be considered, the Port Alfred area is recommended for improved conservation. This study did not examine estuaries, which may require improved conservation efforts. Seaweed distribution data, which are often relatively complete, offer a good tool for planning the siting of coastal MPAs.},

abstract = {The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to meta- population dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection–diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory—an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50–150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island ‘stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connect- ing distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be priori- tized for marine conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Climate effects on the structure and function of marine
communities have received scant attention. The few existing
approaches for predicting climate effects suggest that community
responses might be predicted from the responses of component
populations. These approaches require a very complex
understanding of ecological interactions among populations. An
alternate and informative parallel process is to ask whether it
is possible to make predictions about community level responses
to climate that are independent of knowledge about the identity
and dynamics of component populations. We propose that it is
possible to make such predictions, based on knowledge of the
processes that determine the size–structure of communities. We
suggest that theory that relates metabolic scaling,
predator–prey interactions and energy transfer in size-based
food webs, allows the size–structure and productivity of
communities across a range of trophic levels to be predicted,
provided that predictions of the effects of climate on primary
production are available. One simple application of the
community-focused predictions is to ask whether predictions of
the size composition and abundance of populations for alternate
climate scenarios are compatible with predictions for the size
composition and relative abundance of communities. More
sophisticated treatments could predict the effects of climate
scenarios on multiple interacting populations and compare their
combined size-abundance structure and production with that
predicted for the community under the same climate scenario. The
main weakness of the community approach is that the methods
predict abundance and production by size-class rather than
taxonomic group, and society would be particularly concerned if
climate driven changes had a strong effect on the relative
production of fishable and non-fishable species in the
community. The main strength of the community approach is that
it provides widely applicable `null' models for assessing the
biological effects of climate change and a baseline for model
comparisons.},

abstract = {El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) strongly influences the
global climate system, affecting hydrology in many of the world's
river basins. This raises the prospect of ENSO-driven variability
in global and regional hydroelectric power generation. Here we
study these effects by generating time series of power production
for 1593 hydropower dams, which collectively represent more than
half of the world's existing installed hydropower capacity. The
time series are generated by forcing a detailed dam model with
monthly-resolution, 20th century inflows—the model includes plant
specifications, storage dynamics and realistic operating schemes,
and runs irrespectively of the dam construction year. More than
one third of simulated dams exhibit statistically significant
annual energy production anomalies in at least one of the two
ENSO phases of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a. For most dams, the
variability of relative anomalies in power production tends to be
less than that of the forcing inflows—a consequence of dam design
specifications, namely maximum turbine release rate and reservoir
storage, which allows inflows to accumulate for power generation
in subsequent dry years. Production is affected most prominently
in Northwest United States, South America, Central America, the
Iberian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and Southeast Australia. When
aggregated globally, positive and negative energy production
anomalies effectively cancel each other out, resulting in a weak
and statistically insignificant net global anomaly for both ENSO
phases.},

attenuation appeared to be most dependent on stem density and
the ratio of stem length to water depth. Wave attention
increased slightly with wave height while no clear trend with

as superimposed wave systems revealed a preferential dissipation
of the higher-frequency wave system relative to the
lower-frequency wave system under emergent conditions. Wave
energy loss occurred at all frequencies of both spectral types,
with dissipation increasing with frequency above the spectral
peak. Parameterizing the spectral equilibrium range as a
function of frequency showed a steepening of the spectral tail

abstract = {Foundation species, such as kelp, exert disproportionately strong
community effects and persist, in part, by dominating taxa that
inhibit their regeneration. Human activities which benefit their
competitors, however, may reduce stability of communities,
increasing the probability of phase-shifts. We tested whether a
foundation species (kelp) would continue to inhibit a key
competitor (turf-forming algae) under moderately increased local
(nutrient) and near-future forecasted global pollution (CO(2)).
Our results reveal that in the absence of kelp, local and global
pollutants combined to cause the greatest cover and mass of
turfs, a synergistic response whereby turfs increased more than
would be predicted by adding the independent effects of
treatments (kelp absence, elevated nutrients, forecasted CO(2)).
The positive effects of nutrient and CO(2) enrichment on turfs
were, however, inhibited by the presence of kelp, indicating the
competitive effect of kelp was stronger than synergistic effects
of moderate enrichment of local and global pollutants.
Quantification of physicochemical parameters within experimental
mesocosms suggests turf inhibition was likely due to an effect of
kelp on physical (i.e. shading) rather than chemical conditions.
Such results indicate that while forecasted climates may increase
the probability of phase-shifts, maintenance of intact
populations of foundation species could enable the continued
strength of interactions and persistence of communities.},

Data are presented for 13 daytime deployments of LTV (114 h of observation) and 4 day and night deployments (89 h of observation) in a sandy habitat off the coast of New Hampshire, USA. Analyses of videotapes revealed that traps caught only 6{\%} of the lobsters that entered while allowing 94{\%} to escape. Of those that escaped, 72{\%} left through the entrance and 28{\%} through the escape vent. Lobsters entered the trap at similar rates during the day and night and in sandy and rocky habitats. Lobsters generally began to approach the trap very shortly after deployment, and many appeared to approach several times before entering. These data confirm the results of previous laboratory-based studies in demonstrating that behavioural interactions in and around traps strongly influence the ultimate catch.},

abstract = {Rafting has been inferred as an important dispersal mechanism in the marine environ- ment by many authors. The success of rafting depends critically on the availability of suitable floating substrata. Herein currently available information on floating items that have been reported to carry rafting organisms is summarised. Floating items of biotic origin comprise macroalgae, seeds, wood, other vascular plants, and animal remains. Volcanic pumice (natural) and a diverse array of litter and tar lumps (anthropogenic) are the main floating items of abiotic origin. Macroal- gae, wood, and plastic macrolitter cover a wide range of sizes while pumice, microlitter, and tar lumps typically are {\textless}10 cm in diameter. The longevity of floating items at the sea surface depends on their origin and likelihood to be destroyed by secondary consumers (in increasing order): nonlignified vascular plants/animal carcasses {\textless} macroalgae {\textless} driftwood {\textless} tar lumps/skeletal remains {\textless} plastic litter {\textless} volcanic pumice. In general, abiotic substrata have a higher longevity than biotic substrata, but most abiotic items are of no or only limited food value for potential rafters. Macroalgae are most abundant at mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, driftwood is of major importance in northern and tropical waters, and floating seeds appear to be most common in tropical regions. Volcanic pumice can be found at all latitudes but has primarily been reported from the Pacific Ocean. Plastic litter and tar lumps are most abundant near the centres of human population and activities. In some regions of abundant supply or zones of hydrography-driven accumulation, floating items can be extremely abundant, exceeding 1000 items km –2 . Temporal supply of floating items is variable, being seasonal for most biotic substrata and highly sporadic for some items such as volcanic pumice. Most reported velocities of floating items are in the range of 0.5–1.0 km h –1 , but direct measurements have shown that they occasionally are transported at much faster velocities. Published trajectories of floating items also coincide with the main oceanic currents, even though strong winds may sometimes push them out of the principal current systems. Many studies hint toward floating items to link source regions with coastal sinks, in some cases across long distances and even entire ocean basins. Fossil evidence suggests that rafting has also occurred in palaeo- oceans. During recent centuries and decades the composition and abundance of floating items in the world's oceans have been strongly affected by human activities, in particular logging, river and coastline regulation, and most importantly oil exploitation and plastic production. The currently abundant supply and the characteristics of floating items suggest that rafting continues to be an important dispersal mechanism in present-day oceans.},

abstract = {AbstractIt is generally accepted that variations in algal size
and shape modify flow regimes and can effectively minimize
hydrodynamic stresses. Correlation of thallus morphological
variations with wave exposure has been well documented.
Hydrodynamic performance of various morphologies of the
intertidal kelp species Hedophyllum sessile was studied to
evaluate if the more streamlined morphology effectively reduces
drag forces at sites of high wave-exposure. Morphologies were
collected from sheltered and exposed sites. Morphological
changes that occurred during the winter storm season were
simulated using thalli from the highly wave-exposed site; such
thalli were split lengthwise (to increase blade number) and some
of these individuals were then shortened. Drag forces directly
measured on these morphologies ranged from 0.5 to 4.0 m s?1.
Contrary to original predictions, drag coefficients, drag per
projected area, and E-values were not statistically different
between morphologies within experimental velocities. However, on
average and per surface area, the sheltered and combined split
and shortened morphologies generated more drag forces than the
nonsplit and lengthwise split exposed morphologies. E-values
ranged from ?1.45 to ?1.67 indicating that all morphologies
streamline quickly in flow. The combined split and shortened
morphology did not significantly reduce drag coefficients but
most effectively reduced drag force by size reduction,
illustrating that the most important determinant of drag force
is thallus size not shape.},

abstract = {A long-standing issue in marine biology is identifying spatial scales at which populations of sessile adults are connected by planktonic offspring. We examined the genetic continuity of the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, an abundant member of rocky intertidal communities of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and compared these genetic patterns to the nearshore oceanography described by trajectories of surface drifters. Consistent with its broad dispersal potential, barnacle populations are genetically similar at both mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear (elongation factor 1-alpha) loci across broad swaths of the species' range. In central California, however, there is a striking genetic cline across 475 km of coastline between northern and southern populations. These patterns indicate that gene flow within central California is far more restricted spatially than among other populations. Possible reasons for the steep cline include the slow secondary introgression of historically separated populations, a balance between diversifying selection and dispersal, or some mix of both. Geographic trajectories of oceanic drifters closely parallel geographical patterns of gene flow. Drifters placed to the north (Oregon; approximately 44 degrees N) and south (Santa Barbara, California; approximately 34 degrees N) of the cline disperse hundreds of kilometers within 40 days, yet over the long-term their trajectories never overlapped. The lack of communication between waters originating in Oregon and southern California probably helps to maintain strong genetic differentiation between these regions. More broadly, the geographical variation in gene flow implies that focusing on species-level averages of gene flow can mask biologically important variance within species which reflects local environmental conditions and historical events.},

abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Duarte, Wu, Xiao, Bruhn and Krause-Jensen. Seaweed aquaculture, the fastest-growing component of global food production, offers a slate of opportunities to mitigate, and adapt to climate change. Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO 2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO 2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO 2 km -2 year -1 . Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers.},

abstract = {Five test runs were performed to assess possible bias when performing the loss on ignition (LOI) method to estimate organic matter and carbonate content of lake sediments. An accurate and stable weight loss was achieved after 2 h of burning pure CaCO3 at 950 °C, whereas LOI of pure graphite at 530 °C showed a direct relation to sample size and exposure time, with only 40–70{\%} of the possible weight loss reached after 2 h of exposure and smaller samples losing weight faster than larger ones. Experiments with a standardised lake sediment revealed a strong initial weight loss at 550 °C, but samples continued to lose weight at a slow rate at exposure of up to 64 h, which was likely the effect of loss of volatile salts, structural water of clay minerals or metal oxides, or of inorganic carbon after the initial burning of organic matter. A further test-run revealed that at 550 °C samples in the centre of the furnace lost more weight than marginal samples. At 950 °C this pattern was still apparent but the differences became negligible. Again, LOI was dependent on sample size. An analytical LOI quality control experiment including ten different laboratories was carried out using each laboratory's own LOI procedure as well as a standardised LOI procedure to analyse three different sediments. The range of LOI values between laboratories measured at 550 °C was generally larger when each laboratory used its own method than when using the standard method. This was similar for 950 °C, although the range of values tended to be smaller. The within-laboratory range of LOI measurements for a given sediment was generally small. Comparisons of the results of the individual and the standardised method suggest that there is a laboratory-specific pattern in the results, probably due to differences in laboratory equipment and/or handling that could not be eliminated by standardising the LOI procedure. Factors such as sample size, exposure time, position of samples in the furnace and the laboratory measuring affected LOI results, with LOI at 550 °C being more susceptible to these factors than LOI at 950 °C. We, therefore, recommend analysts to be consistent in the LOI method used in relation to the ignition temperatures, exposure times, and the sample size and to include information on these three parameters when referring to the method.},

(Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and OrbView-2 SeaWiFS
(Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) are used to investigate
the upper layer dynamics of the southern Benguela ecosystem in
more detailed space and time scales than previously undertaken.
A consistent time-series of daily sea surface temperature (SST)
and chlorophyll a concentration images is generated for the
period July 1998?June 2003, and a quantitative analysis
undertaken. The variability in SST, upwelling and phytoplankton
biomass is explored for selected biogeographic regions, with
particular focus on intra-seasonal time scales. The location and
emergence of upwelling cells are clearly identified along the
length of the southern Benguela, being distinct on the narrow
inner and the mid-continental shelves. Most notable is the
rapidly pulsating nature of the upwelling, with intense
warm/cold events clearly distinguished. The phytoplankton
response to this physical forcing is described. Chlorophyll
concentration on the inner shelf largely mirrors the pattern of
SST variability, similarly dominated by event-scale processes.
Over the mid-shelf, higher chlorophyll is observed throughout
all seasons, although low biomass occurs during winter. The
variability of the offshore extent of SST and chlorophyll is
identified at locations of differing shelf width. Cooler
upwelled water is confined primarily to the narrow inner-shelf,
with event-scale pulses extending considerable distances
offshore. Agulhas Current influences are readily observed, even
on the Cape Peninsula inner-shelf. Chlorophyll concentrations
vary considerably between the locations of differing shelf
width. SST, upwelling and phytoplankton indices are derived for
selected locations to quantify the intra-seasonal variations.
The SST indices show marked temperature changes associated with
rapid pulsation on the event scale. No strong seasonal signal is
evident. In contrast, the upwelling indices display a strong
seasonal signal, with most intense upwelling occurring in
spring/summer in the south. The phytoplankton response to the
seasonal upwelling index differs between the selected locations.
This study concludes that, although low-resolution SST and
chlorophyll data may be useful for investigating general
patterns over large scales, higher resolution data are necessary
to identify finer scale spatial and temporal variability,
especially in the inshore coastal zones.},

Comparing transports in the EACC with those in the boundary current north of Madagascar, it seems that most of the water in the upper 300 dbar of the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current goes into the EACC. Below 300 dbar there is an excess westward transport north of Madagascar which probably goes into the Mozambique Channel. At its northern end, in northern winter the EACC converges with the south-going Somali Current to form the Equatorial Countercurrent, with an eastward transport of about 22 Sv (0-300 dbar). In northern summer, the EACC merges into the north-going Somali Current.},

We use binary (presence/absence) and per-species biomass data collected at fifteen localities and thirty-seven different rocky sites, encompassing the shores of southern Namibia, South Africa and southern Mozambique. Multivariate analyses revealed that the shores of southern Africa (south of 250) can be divided into three main biogeographic provinces: the west coast or Namaqua province, the south coast or Agulhas province and the east coast or Natal province. The biomass structure of the intertidal rocky shores communities of southern Africa varied at a large scale, corresponding to biogeographic differences, while local-scale variation accorded with the intensity of local wave action. The average biomass of west coast communities was on average significantly greater than that of the south and east provinces. At a local scale, the community biomass on exposed shores was an order of magnitude greater than on sheltered shores, within all biogeographic provinces. Semi-exposed shores exhibited intermediate average biomass. The trophic structure of these communities varied significantly with wave action: autotrophs, filter-feeders and invertebrate predators were more prevalent on wave exposed than sheltered shores, whereas grazers were more abundant on sheltered and semi-exposed shores. Exposed shores were consistently dominated by far fewer species than semi- exposed and sheltered shores, independently of biogeographic differences. Within all biogeographic provinces semi- exposed and sheltered shores were more diverse than exposed shores. West coast intertidal communities therefore had high levels of biomass, but were consistently species- poor. Several working hypotheses that could explain these large and small-scale patterns are presented.},

abstract = {Environmental conditions that are known to cause morphological
variation in algae (e.g., wave exposure) often vary in both space
and time and are superimposed onto the distinct seasonal growth
cycles of most temperate macroalgae. We tested the hypothesis
that the morphology of the small kelp Ecklonia radiata (C.
Agardh) J. Agardh is the product of an interaction between site
(five reefs of different wave exposure) and the time of year that
sampling occurs (summer vs. winter 2004). We determined that wave
exposure had a strong directional effect on kelp morphology, with
?Reefs? accounting for up to 43.4{\%} of variation in individual
morphological characters. ?Times? had a narrowly nonsignificant
effect on overall morphology but accounted for up to 31{\%} of
variation in individual characters. Many characters were affected
by wave exposure, whereas only a few were (strongly) affected by
time (e.g., thallus biomass). Interactive effects between ?Reefs?
and ?Times? were generally small, accounting for 15.8{\%} of
variation in lamina thickness, but much less for most other
characters. We conclude that wave exposure exerts a strong
control over the morphology of E. radiata, but that the nature of
the effect depends on the magnitude of wave exposure. We also
conclude that most of the effects of wave exposure are consistent
through time and do not interact with cycles of growth and

abstract = {To determine the patterns of occurrence and importance of
indirect effects relative to direct effects in natural
communities, I analyzed experimentally based studies from 23
rocky intertidal habitats. The vehicle of analysis was the
construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in
food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused
on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or
interaction chains, since little information was available on
other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response,
environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong)
interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing
indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone
predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web
species richness. Less expected, when these measures were
adjusted to a per species basis, positive rela- tionships with
species richness were still observed for all measures but the
number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity,
each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved
in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction
pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect,
including the seven previously iden- tified types. Many of the 76
additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if
the original definitions of these ``classic'' types were expanded
to include interactions having similar effects but differing in
the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference com- petition and
inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects
involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect,
termed ``apparent predation'' and ``indirect defense'' were also
identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect
effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these,
keystone predation (35{\%}) and apparent com- petition (25{\%}) were
most common and exploitation competition (2.8{\%}) was least common
in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect
effects accounted for -40{\%} of the change in community structure
resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24-61{\%}. The
proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with
web species richness, in- dicating that strong direct
interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level
of alteration of community structure regardless of the level of
web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were
evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of
taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied
significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias
toward manipulation of consumers over ma- nipulation of basal
species, some predator-initiated indirect effect types were
scarce while some basal species-initiated types were common.
While the frequency of exploitation com- petition may have been
underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this
indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this
effect should have been detected in many of the studies and
reported; and the most intensively studied individual webs did
not report frequencies differing much from the average. This
analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first
manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects
and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect
effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect
effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of

abstract = {Mechanisms of high-temperature tolerance in the kelp Laminaria
saccharina (L.) Lamour. were examined by comparing a
heat-tolerant ecotype from Long Island Sound (LIS), New York,
and a population from the Atlantic (ATL) coast of Maine. Greater
heat tolerance was not attributable to greater thermal stability
of the photosynthetic apparatus: LIS and ATL plants exhibited
similar short-term effects of high temperature on photosynthetic
capacity (P(max)) and quantum yield (estimated as the ratio of
variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence, F(v)/F(m)). As LIS
plants had consistently higher N and protein content than ATL
plants, the interaction between nitrogen nutrition and
high-temperature tolerance was examined. When grown under high N
supply and optimal temperature (12°C), LIS plants had a higher
density of photosystem II reaction centers (RCII), higher
activity of two Calvin cycle enzymes (ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase [RUBISCO] and NADP-dependent
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [G3PDH]), and higher
P(max) and F(v)/F(m) than ATL plants. Individual ATL plants,
furthermore, exhibited close correlations of RCII density and
enzyme activity with N and/or protein content. Variation in RCII
density and enzyme activity, in turn, largely accounted for
plant-to-plant differences in P(max) and F(v)/F(m).
Relationships among these parameters were generally weak or
lacking among individual LIS plants grown under optimal
conditions, apparently because luxury N consumption resulted in
excess reserves of photosynthetic apparatus components. Exposure
of N-replete LIS and ATL plants to a superoptimal temperature
(22°C) for 4 days caused an increase in the minimum turnover
time of the photosynthetic apparatus (tau) and a decrease in
P(max), but had no consistent effect on F(v)/F(m), RCII density,
PSU size (chlorophyll a/RCII), or enzyme activities. When plants
were subjected to concurrent N limitation and heat stress,
however, LIS and ATL populations exhibited quite different
responses. All photosynthetic parameters of N-limited ATL plants
declined sharply in response to high temperature, resulting in a
negative rate of daily net C fixation. In contrast, LIS plants
showed a reduction in PSU size, but maintained other parameters,
including daily C fixation, at levels similar to those of
N-limited plants at optimal temperature. Overall, the ability of
LIS plants to accumulate and maintain high N reserves appears to
be critical for heat tolerance and, therefore, for survival
during summer periods of simultaneous low N supply and
superoptimal temperature. ATL plants, which also experience low
summer N supply but not superoptimal temperatures, do not
accumulate large reserves of nitrogenous components and are
unable to tolerate the combined stress. Because low N supply
often co-occurs with high temperatures in temperate marine
systems, large-scale declines in algal productivity, such as
during El Nino events, are probably due to the interactive
effect of N limitation and heat stress.},

Hence, this factor is at a high level in the hierarchical habitat classification system EUNIS and is one of the Water Framework Directive water typology criteria of coastal waters. Is{\ae}us (2004) has developed a continuous simplified wave model (SWM) that has been applied to several Nordic countries. Here we refine this model by introducing depth-attenuation, giving us the advantage of a model for wave exposure as it will actually work at the seabed. The values of the depth-attenuated model SWM(d) are approximately similar to the SWM model in shallow areas but noticeably lower in deep areas. The two models were compared in an analysis of the distribution of seabed substrate in the Stockholm archipelago. Using the depth-attenuated wave exposure instead of the SWM model as predictor in substrate modeling improved these models considerably.},

Recovery of M. pyrifera populations from decreased adult density was a 2-stage process requiring the establishment of juvenile populations and conditions suitable for juvenile growth to adult size. Sporophyte recruitment was negatively correlated with M. pyrifera canopy cover, and thus appeared to be related to irradiance. Distinct patterns in sporophyte recruitment resulted in continuous juvenile populations at the protected site and intermittent juvenile populations at the intermediate and exposed sites. Episodic sporophyte recruitment at the intermediate and exposed sites resulted in decreased coincidence of the two recovery stages.},

abstract = {Plant species from open habitats often show pronounced responses
to shading. Apart from a reduction in growth, shading can lead to
marked changes in morphology and architecture, and it may affect
the rate of plant development. Natural shade comprises two
basically different features, a reduction in light quantity
(amount of radiation) and changes in the spectral light quality.
The first aspect represents changes in resource availability,
while the latter acts as a source of information for plants and
can prompt morphogenetic responses. A greenhouse experiment was
carried out to study the effects of changes in light quality and
quantity on the growth, morphology and development of two
stoloniferous Potentilla species. Individual plants were
subjected to three light treatments: (1) full daylight (control);
and two shade treatments, in which (2) light quantity (photon
flux density) and (3) light spectral quality (red/far-red ratio)
were changed independently. Plant development was followed
throughout the study. Morphological parameters, biomass and
clonal offspring production were measured at the end of the
experiment. Morphological traits such as petiole length, leaf
blade characteristics and investment patterns into spacers showed
high degrees of shade-induced plasticity in both species. With a
few exceptions, light quality mainly affected morphological
variables, while production parameters were most responsive to
changes in light quantity. Potentilla anserina allocated
resources preferentially to established rosettes at the cost of
stolen growth and branching, while in P. reptans, all parameters
related to development and allocation were slowed down to the
same extent by light limitation. Light quality changes also
positively affected biomass production via changes in leaf
allocation. Changes in the spectral light quality had major
effects on the size of modular structures (leaves, ramets),
whereas changes in light quantity mainly affected their numbers.},

abstract = {Spiny lobsters, Panulirus interruptus (Randall), are important predators of two species of sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus (A. Agassiz) and S. purpuratus (Stimpson), which are major herbivores in southern California kelp forest communities. Aquarium experiments indicate that spiny lobsters strongly prefer S. purpuratus over S. franciscanus of comparable test diameter, probably accounting for the higher number of S. purpuratus mortalities observed in the field. Juvenile S. franciscanus ({\textless} 60 mm test diameter, TD) are preferred over larger conspecifics, but the smallest S. franciscanus ({\textless} 30 mm TD) are protected by association with the adult urchin spine canopy. Mid-sized S. franciscanus too large to fit under the spine canopy are subject to intense predation. All sizes of P. interruptus tested showed a notable reluctance to attack large S. franciscanus ({\textgreater} 90 mm TD) when offered a range of sizes, although the larger lobsters are capable of handling the largest urchins. Relative movement, spine length, test thickness, and gonad weights of sea urchins were examined to evaluate the factors affecting the lobsters' choice of prey, and behavioral responses to lobsters were assessed to determine urchin availability to these predators. The handling problems associated with the long spines of larger S. franciscanus appear to be the major considerations in prey choice despite the much greater potential energy gain from these urchins. Thus predation by spiny lobsters appears to be sufficient to explain the bimodal size-frequency distribution typical of S. franciscanus populations in areas where these predators are common. Heavy fishing pressure on spiny lobsters during this century probably resulted in the release of sea urchin populations and contributed to episodes of destructive urchin grazing observed in the 1950's and subsequent years. ?? 1983.},

the rafts of floating seaweed in the waters off the coasts of
northeastern Asia. These rafts serve as spawning and nursery
grounds for many marine organisms, including Japanese saury and
yellowtail. Thus, the details of the attachment/detachment
mechanisms of S. horneri are of commercial significance for the
aquaculture industry. Here, we describe variations in the
attachment strength of S. horneri as it relates to its
developmental stage and depth along a bottom gradient. We
measured the attachment strength/dislodgement force of S.
horneri samples with holdfast detachment in Shidagaura Cove,
Shimoda, Japan, from December 2014 to May 2015. After we had
determined the dislodgement forces required to detach thalli
from the substratum (using a spring scale device) in the field,
we transferred released individuals to the laboratory and
measured selected morphological traits. Attachment strength was
linearly related to the holdfast basal area when thalli were
immature (prior to mid-March), but not when they were mature
(mid-March to May). Thus, attachment strength was maintained
through the reproductive phase and declined thereafter, allowing
released thalli to join the drifting raft community. Rafting may
be a mechanism by which the species expands its distribution
range, as floating thalli continuing to shed germlings that are
able to recruit when suitable habitat is encountered. Attachment
strengths were greater in the shallows than in deeper water,
reflecting the differences in wave forces experienced at
different depths.},

The growth forms of these species were collected along a gradient of the amount of water movement. In this analysis it is demonstrated that, although these species are from very different taxonomical groups, the degree of compactness of the growth forms shows a similar trend as a response to the exposure to water movement. In all three species the growth forms gradually change from thin-branching to more compact shapes, as evaluated by measurements of various morphological characteristics. Other morphological measurements, in particular the average distance between branch tips and neighbouring branches ({\^{a}}€{\oe}branch spacing{\^{a}}€ ) show a more species-specific pattern. Species in which fusion of branches is almost never observed, as for example P. damicornis, are characterized by a relatively low standard deviation of branch spacing. Species in which anastomosis frequently occurs (H. oculata and M. alcicornis) are characterized by a relatively high standard deviation in branch spacing. The final aim of this research approach is to use the morphological data acquired here in combination with morphological simulation models to gain a better understanding of the growth and form of these organisms and the impact of the physical environment (hydrodynamics and availability of light required for photosynthesis).},

Evidence of the declines of kelp forests exists from several regions, but their effects on fisheries still need to be elucidated. More effective management strategies for sus- tainable fisheries require a synthesis of research findings and an assessment of how research could be improved to fill current gaps. 2. This review aimed to: (i) summarize the available evidence on the influence of changes in kelp density and/or area on the abundance and diversity of associated fisheries and (ii) exam- ine how research on kelp–fisheries interactions could better support effective management. 3. Most studies (67{\%}) reported data ascribable, directly or indirectly, to a positive relation- ship between kelp and fishery-relevant variables, 11{\%} provided evidence of a negative rela- tionship, 15{\%} indicated species-specific findings and the remaining found unclear or ‘neutral' relationships. 4. Important shortcomings were identified, including the paucity of experimental studies suit- able to test for unequivocal cause–effect relationships, the disproportion between North Amer- ica, which is well-studied, and other regions and between the large number of fish-based investigations and the small number of those focusing on other commercially important organ- isms, and the general lack of studies carried out over spatial and temporal scales comparable to those of global processes driving patterns of distribution of both kelps and fisheries. 5. Synthesis and applications. The consistency of most studies in showing a positive kelp–fish- ery relationship supports the protection of kelp habitats stated by current environmental directives. However, achieving their goals requires that the limitations we detect are addressed through better connections between research, management practice and policy. This would require the following: (i) researchers to combine multiple approaches (large-scale experimental studies and modelling) for the analysis of kelp–fisheries relationships; (ii) fund- ing agencies to provide resources needed to fill the existing gaps; and (iii) researchers and institutions from less studied regions to strengthen collaborations with those from regions where there have been more investigations into kelp–fishery systems. This is essential under present and predicted environmental changes, with the ultimate aim of conserving and allow- ing the sustainable use of critically important habitats and of fishery resources relying on these.

abstract = {One of the most commonly predicted effects of global ocean warming on marine communities is a poleward shift in the distributional boundaries of species with an associated replacement of cold-water species by warm-water species. However, these types of predictions are imprecise and based largely on broad correlations in uncontrolled studies that examine changes in the distribution or abundances of species in relation to seawater temperature. Our study used an 18-year sampling program in intertidal and subtidal habitats and before-after, control-impact analyses. We show that a 3.5degreesC rise in seawater temperature, induced by the thermal outfall of a power-generating station, over 10 years along 2 km of rocky coastline in California resulted in significant community-wide changes in 150 species of algae and invertebrates relative to adjacent control areas experiencing natural temperatures. Contrary to predictions based on current biogeographic models, there was no trend toward warmer-water species with southern geographic affinities replacing colder-water species with northern affinities. Instead, the communities were greatly altered in apparently cascading responses to changes in abundance of several key taxa, particularly habitat-forming subtidal kelps and intertidal foliose red algae. Many temperature-sensitive algae decreased greatly in abundance, whereas many invertebrate grazers increased. The responses of these benthic communities to ocean warming were-mostly unpredicted and strongly, coupled to direct effects of temperature on key taxa and indirect effects operating through ecological interactions.},

tens of kilometers offshore; however, many types remain within
the coastal boundary layer where currents are slower and more
variable, leading to lower than predicted dispersal. At short
PDs, dispersal distances estimated from genetic data are similar
to observed. At long PDs, genetic data generally overestimate
dispersal distance. This discrepancy is probably due to the
effect of rare individuals that disperse long distances, thus
smoothing genetic differences between populations. Larval

abstract = {Aim In the Indo-Pacific, the mass of islands of the Indonesian archipelago constitute a major biogeographical barrier (the Indo-Pacific Barrier, IPB) separating the Pacific and Indian oceans. Evidence for other, more localized barriers include high rates of endemism at the Marquesas and other isolated peripheral islands in the Pacific. Here we use mitochondrial-sequence comparisons to evaluate the efficacy of biogeographical barriers on populations of the snappers Lutjanus kasmira and Lutjanus fulvus across their natural ranges. Location Pacific and Indian oceans. Methods Mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence data were obtained from 370 individuals of L. kasmira and 203 individuals of L. fulvus collected from across each species' range. Allele frequency data for two nuclear introns were collected from L. kasmira. Phylogenetic and population-level analyses were used to determine patterns of population structure in these species and to identify barriers to dispersal. Results Lutjanus kasmira lacks genetic structure across the IPB and throughout 12,000 km of its central Indo-Pacific range. In contrast, L. fulvus demonstrates high levels of population structure at all geographical scales. In both species, highly significant population structure results primarily from the phylogenetic distinctiveness of their Marquesas Islands populations (L. kasmira, d = 0.50–0.53{\%}; L. fulvus, d = 0.87–1.50{\%}). Coalescence analyses of the L. kasmira data indicate that populations at opposite ends of its range (western Indian Ocean and the Marquesas) are the oldest. Coalescence analyses for L. fulvus are less robust but also indicate colonization from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean. Main conclusions The IPB does not act as a biogeographical barrier to L. kasmira, and, in L. fulvus, its effects are no stronger than isolating mechanisms elsewhere. Both species demonstrate a strong genetic break at the Marquesas. Population divergence and high endemism in that archipelago may be a product of geographical isolation enhanced by oceanographic currents that limit gene flow to and from those islands, and adaptation to unusual ecological conditions. Lutjanus kasmira shows evidence of Pleistocene population expansion throughout the Indo-central Pacific that originated in the western Indian Ocean rather than the Marquesas, further demonstrating a strong barrier at the latter location.},

sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii; the limpets Patelloida
alticostata, P. mufria, and Cellana tra- moserica; and the

filamentous algae the cover declined to be only slightly more
than in control areas. These results were similar at all sites
and times. In one series of removals, the effects of some of the
species of limpets were separated. In this case, the increase in
the cover of algae was found to be fastest when only P. mufria
was left (the urchins and other limpets removed), than when all
limpets and urchins had been removed. Initially, the removal of
the urchins generally resulted in a large increase in the re-
cruitment and density of the limpets. Approximately 1 yr
following the removal of the urchins, however, the density of
adult and juvenile limpets of all species had declined to near
zero. Removal of the larger species of limpets, P. alticostata
and Cellana, also increased the rate of recruitment of the
smaller species, P. mufria. Thus, these invertebrate grazers,
especially the sea urchins, appeared to be necessary for the
maintenance of the areas of crustose algae. Similarly, the sea
urchins were found to be necessary for the continued presence of
the limpets within these areas. The strong effects of the urchins
on this community, and the application of the situation to
theories concerning keystone species and facilitation, are
discussed in relation to the important but more subtle effects of
the limpets},

abstract = {The effect of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the probability distribution of daily surface air temperature over the Pacific-North American sector is investigated using the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis data for 1959-1998. The El Nino response is characterized by reduced intraseasonal variance over most of the US, western Canada and the Gulf of Alaska. Conversely, there is an increase of variance during La Nino over the US and the west coast, northward to Alaska. The sign of this response is consistent for most individual El Nino/La Nina years in regions with a strong signal. The response is also robust with respect to differing definitions of ENSO or choice of dataset. Finally, a similar response is evident in station data for an earlier period. The change of variance is associated both with altered skewness, and a change in high and low extremes. Extremes of both signs are reduced during El Nino, and are slightly increased during La Nina. These results are consistent with other studies, suggesting an increased incidence of blocking along the west coast of North America during El Nino, leading to less storm activity and less incursions of warm and cold air over the eastern US. While an understanding of the changed variance is important in itself, it also has implications for changes in exceedence statistics (e.g. heating degree days) and the occurrence of extreme values.

life stages can strongly affect the distribution, dynamics,
structure, and gene flow of local populations. I investigated
the causes of variable larval recruitment to populations of a
temperate reef fish, the kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus).
Spatial and temporal variation in the density of settlement
habitat on a reef, the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera),
explained much of the variation in recruitment of kelp bass.
Although recruitment was positively related to Macrocystis
density, the relationship was asymptotic at high plant
densities, indicating that kelp bass recruitment saturates at
intermediate densities of Macrocystis (°100?130 stipes/30 m2).
Field experiments demonstrated causation between Macrocystis
density and kelp bass recruitment and indicated that kelp bass
recruitment was linearly related to the local abundance of kelp
structure (i.e., the number and biomass of overlapping
Macrocystis blades). This linear (nonasymptotic) relationship
between Macrocystis blade biomass and density of fish recruits
indicated that both the quantity and quality of the recruitment
habitat limited larval recruitment. Structural complexity per
unit length of plant (e.g., blade biomass per unit plant length)
was inversely related to plant density. This relationship
underlies the asymptotic relationship between structural
complexity per unit reef area (the product of per?plant
structural complexity and plant density) and recruit density.
Thus, density?dependent constraints on blade biomass in the
macroalga, rather than larval supply, better explained the
general asymptotic nature of the relationship between
Macrocystis and kelp bass recruitment. These results indicate
that density?dependent effects on plant biomass and architecture
(e.g., plant height and structural complexity), common among
both macrophytes and terrestrial plants, can greatly influence
the relationship between plant density and recruitment of other
species. For organisms with dispersive life stages whose local
recruitment is influenced by the occurrence of living habitat
structure, spatial and temporal variability characteristic of
such biogenic habitats can be a major source of variation in
their recruitment.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Greater attention to habitat-specific species interactions should improve our ability to predict the context-dependency of species interactions. Predator avoidance depends upon resource traits that can vary predictably between habitats, but few studies have linked predator avoidance to habitat-specific resource traits. For example, predator avoidance in herbivores may depend upon wave exposure, because wave-exposed and wave-protected seaweeds display strong intraspecific differences in morphology and physiology that likely influence their value to herbivores. In 2 sets of laboratory mesocosm experiments we compared predator avoidance in the herbivorous snail Littorina obtusata offered the bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus from either wave-exposed or protected shores. The effect of predation risk by the green crab Carcinus maenas on avoidance by L. obtusata depended on wave exposure, with a stronger effect of predation risk for snails on wave-exposed F. vesiculosus. To explore the traits responsible for this pattern, we conducted multi-choice feeding experiments with F. vesiculosus from 3 wave-exposed and 3 protected sites. F. vesiculosus from protected sites (where avoidance behaviors were weak) was more palatable than F. vesiculosus from wave-exposed sites. Although several morphological (e.g. blade width and vesicle number) and physiological traits (e.g. C:N ratio) of F. vesiculosus depended upon wave exposure, these were unrelated to snail feeding and predator avoidance. Therefore, L. obtusata displayed stronger predator avoidance on less palatable, wave-exposed seaweed. We suggest that the different effects of predators on rocky shores may partly reflect the influence of exposure-specific seaweed traits that determine predator avoidance.},

@article{Gaylord2004,
abstract = {The physical-biological linkages controlling the dispersal of spores produced by macroalgae that reside in kelp forests are complicated and laced with feedbacks. Here we discuss the fundamental elements of these interactions. Biological considerations include spore swimming and sinking speeds, their periods of viability in the plankton, and the height of spore release above the seafloor, which together determine the durations over which spores can be swept by horizontal currents before they contact the seafloor. Morphologies and material properties of canopy forming kelps may also influence the drag exerted on passing waters by the kelps, the plants' ability to persist in the face of rapid flows, and thereby the degree to which impinging currents are redirected around, or slowed within, kelp forests. Macroalgal life histories, and the size of spore sources as controlled by the dimensions of kelp forests and the density and fecundity of individuals within them, influence effective dispersal distances as well. Physical considerations encompass the mean speed, direction, and timescales of variability of currents relative to spore suspension times, the interaction of surface gravity waves with currents in producing turbulence in the benthic boundary layer, wind-driven surface mixing, water stratification, and shoreline bathymetry and substratum roughness, all of which can affect the interplay of vertical and horizontal transport of macroalgal spores. Intricate within-forest processes may induce attenuation of current speeds and consequent reductions in seabed shear, along with simultaneous production of small-scale turbulence in kelp wakes. Slower mean currents and smaller eddy scales in turn may attenuate vertical mixing within forests, thus extending spore suspension times. Further complexities likely arise due to changes in the relative rates of horizontal and vertical dispersion, modifications to the overall profiles of vertical mixing, and the creation of fine-scale secondary flows around kelp individuals and substratum features. Under conditions of more rapid currents, submergence of the surface canopy and the establishment of skimming flows at the canopy-fluid interface may introduce additional coherent flow structures that alter rates of fluid exchange to and from the forest. Many of these coupled physical-biological processes are just beginning to be examined in a rigorous fashion in kelp forests, but their potential importance is clear. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Temperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and its waters have experienced well-above global average rates of ocean warming. We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidification, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region specific with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east–west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems.},

Distribution and abundance patterns of C. ornata were described in relation to other biota and tidal height. C. ornata occurred almost exclusively in patches devoid of macroalgae, particularly in the mid-tidal zone. Both adult and juvenile limpets were most abundant on the tops of boulders, where their numbers were positively correlated with barnacle cover, which averaged 77{\%}. The size structure and growth patterns of C. ornata were different between populations. Mark-recapture studies showed that the slopes of annual growth increments regressed on initial sizes were similar at both sites but that the annual increments on the platform were about 6 mm greater than on boulders. Growth virtually ceased at 27 mm for limpets at the barnacle-dominated boulder site and at 40 mm at the platform site. Recruiting cohorts had 20{\%} survival on boulders and 37{\%} on the platform during their first year. The largest size classes at both sites had around 57{\%} annual survival. To test the effects of varying limpet densities on the growth and mortality of limpets and the maintenance of bare patches, densities of C. ornata were experimentally increased at both sites. Beyond a density of 4 per 0.25 m2, sizes and survival of limpets were reduced at both sites, but the effect was more pronounced at the boulder site. Limpets at the boulder site were more effective at maintaining bare space than those on the reef platform. Enclosing limpets in plots with and without barnacles showed that C. ornata and a co-occurring species (Cellana denticulata (Martyn)) grazed more effectively and had greater growth in cleared plots. Overall, there was considerable variation in the demographics of C. ornata between populations driven by site-specific characteristics. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ocean waves impose large hydrodynamic forces on organisms living on rocky shores. Many intertidal organisms are structurally flexible, and the effect of this flexibility on the mechanical forces they experience is poorly understood. In addition, organisms in the rocky intertidal zone are generally much smaller than those in subtidal or terrestrial habitats. This study examined the influence of structural flexibility on the forces imposed by waves on the intertidal seaweed Pelvetiopsis limitata, including the potential for a mechanical size constraint on this species. A mechanical model of a seaweed on a wave-swept shore was developed on the basis of laboratory measurements of algal characteristics. Computer simulations predict that flexibility dramatically increases the forces imposed on the algae, particularly for large individuals. Along with field data on wave conditions and algal tenacity, this indicates that large algae are more likely to be dislodged than small ones throughout the year, and that very large individuals are expected to survive only during the summer and early fall. Measurements of thallus size in a population of P. limitata during a 2 yr period corroborated these model predictions. Algae in the field developed reproductive structures during the summer and early fall, when they were the largest and waves were the smallest. Thus, P. limitata exhibits a life-history strategy in which it grows large when seasonal wave conditions permit, and reproduces before becoming dislodged by large winter waves, mitigating the reproductive consequences of a mechanical size constraint. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

Factorial Analysis of Correspondence (FAC) were used to
determine the structure of the macroalgae community in this
area. The sites influenced by the upwelling waters showed lower
water temperature values and higher nutrient concentrations in
the spring-summer upwelling period. The benthic flora survey
recorded elements with warm temperate affinities (i.e. Ceramium
diaphanum (Lightfoot) Roth, Polysiphonia decussata Hollenberg
and Endarachne binghamiae J. Agardh) and algae with tropical
affinities (i.e. Gelidiopsis gracilis (K{\"{u}}tzing) Vickers,
Dictyota cervicornis K{\"{u}}tzing and Caulerpa racemosa (Forssk{\aa}l) J.
Agardh). In general the local flora showed a peak in
reproduction during the spring-summer period. The multivariate
analysis distinguished the sites influenced by upwelling waters,
and some samples taken in the same inlet suggested that further
differences in the floral composition were due to wave exposure.},

abstract = {We tested the ability of sporophytes of a small kelp, Ecklonia
radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, to adjust their photosynthesis,
respiration, and cellular processes to increasingly warm ocean
climates along a latitudinal gradient in ocean temperature
(∼4°C). Tissue concentrations of pigment and nutrients decreased
with increasing ocean temperature. Concurrently, a number of
gradual changes in the metabolic balance of E. radiata took place
along the latitudinal gradient. Warm-acclimatized kelps had 50{\%}
lower photosynthetic rates and 90{\%} lower respiration rates at
the optimum temperature than did cool-acclimatized kelps. A
reduction in temperature sensitivity was also observed as a
reduction in Q10-values from cool- to warm-acclimatized kelps for
gross photosynthesis (Q10: 3.35 to 1.45) and respiration (Q10:
3.82 to 1.65). Respiration rates were more sensitive to
increasing experimental temperatures (10{\%} higher Q10-values)
than photosynthesis and had a higher optimum temperature,
irrespective of sampling location. To maintain a positive carbon
balance, E. radiata increased the critical light demand (Ec)
exponentially with increasing experimental temperature. The
temperature dependency of Ec was, however, weakened with
increasing ocean temperature, such that the critical light demand
was relaxed in kelp acclimated to higher ocean temperatures.
Nevertheless, calculations of critical depth limits suggested
that direct effects of future temperature increases are unlikely
to be as strong as effects of reduced water clarity, another
globally increasing problem in coastal areas.},

abstract = {Knowledge of early life history of most fish species in the
Mediterranean Sea is sparse and processes affecting their
recruitment are poorly understood. This is particularly true for
bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, even though this species is one
of the world's most valued fish species. Here we develop, apply
and validate an individually based coupled biological–physical
oceanographic model of fish early life history in the
Mediterranean Sea. We first validate the general structure of
the coupled model with a 12-day Lagrangian drift study of
anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) larvae in the Catalan Sea. The
model reproduced the drift and growth of anchovy larvae as they
drifted along the Catalan coast and yielded similar patterns as
those observed in the field. We then applied the model to
investigate transport and retention processes affecting the
spatial distribution of bluefin tuna eggs and larvae during
1999–2003, and we compared modelled distributions with available
field data collected in 2001 and 2003. Modelled and field
distributions generally coincided and were patchy at mesoscales
(10s–100skm); larvae were most abundant in eddies and along
frontal zones. We also identified probable locations of spawning
bluefin tuna using hydrographic backtracking procedures; these
locations were situated in a major salinity frontal zone and
coincided with distributions of an electronically tagged bluefin
tuna and commercial bluefin tuna fishing vessels. Moreover, we
hypothesized that mesoscale processes are responsible for the
aggregation and dispersion mechanisms in the area and showed
that these processes were significantly correlated to
atmospheric forcing processes over the NW Mediterranean Sea.
Interannual variations in average summer air temperature can
reduce the intensity of ocean mesoscale processes in the
Balearic area and thus potentially affect bluefin tuna larvae.
These modelling approaches can increase understanding of bluefin
tuna recruitment processes and eventually contribute to
management of bluefin tuna fisheries.},

The discovery that Porphyra improves growth of South African abalone ( Haliotis midae) farmed in land-based tanks has led to increased pressure to harvest wild populations. This paper reports on a survey of the distribution and seasonality of Porphyra in the southern Western Cape. Porphyra was present at all sites surveyed, and showed considerable temporal variation. A significant amount of the Porphyra present is in reserves and therefore protected from harvesting. Closer examination of one site revealed seasonal populations of Porphyra that occupied different niches dependent on season. Recruitment peaked in spring and autumn, leading to dense summer and winter populations. Summer populations generally grew lower in the eulittoral than winter populations. No pattern in the mortality of larger thalli was detected, though sporeling mortality was high following recruitment peaks. Although it seems that most sites in the southern Western Cape are suitable for harvesting, the taxonomy of the genus in the region urgently needs revision if populations are to be appropriately managed},

@article{Gaylord1997-xf,
abstract = {Wave action on exposed rocky coasts can be severe, generating
large hydrodynamic forces that have been proposed to constrain
the size of intertidal animals and plants. In contrast, flows
subtidally are more benign, and organisms, particularly seaweeds,
may grow quite large. The large dimensions of these flexible
macroalgae allow them to move during much or most of a passing
wave cycle, reducing relative water velocities and modifying the
forces the plants must endure. The consequences of such
wave-induced motion are explored for the stipitate understory
kelps Eisenia arborea and Pterygophora californica using a
numerical model that approximates these seaweeds as vertically
oriented cantilever beams subjected to lateral hydrodynamic
forces acting at their stipe tips. Bending moments and peak
stresses induced in the stipes of these species during the
passage of waves are calculated as functions of plant size and
shape and of water depth and sea state. Model predictions for a
subset of conditions are validated against real-time measurements
of bending moments acting on a Pterygophora individual in the
field. The results suggest that the allometric patterns of growth
exhibited by Eisenia and Pterygophora can greatly reduce the
stresses generated in the stipes of these plants relative to
isometric growth. Low stipe stiffness acts as a general,
particularly effective, stress-lowering mechanism. The dynamic
swaying associated with this low stiffness can also modulate the
magnitudes of peak stresses induced in the stipes of these kelps.
In particular, in shallow water under large waves, dynamic
loading can substantially increase induced stress, suggesting
that plant motion is an important factor affecting the loading
regime encountered by these organisms.},

abstract = {Recruitment from newly settled propagules is an important process in the population dynamics of many species, especially those living in highly disturbed areas and subjected to frequent local extinctions. For many primitive plants such as kelps (large brown algae in the order Laminariales), the process of recruitment (i.e., the first appearance of macroscopic individuals) is quite complex and requires the successful completion of an alternate microscopic free-living sexual stage. To experimentally investigate the conse- quences of variable spore settlement and early (i.e., prerecruit) competition on the recruit- ment patterns of the sympatric sublittoral kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica, I seeded bare rock substrates with known densities of spores of the two algae in both single- and mixed-species assemblages. Results from 12 field experiments done over 3 yr indicated that for both kelps, a minimum density of at least 1 spore/mm2 was needed for successful recruitment. This minimum density was probably determined in part by the maximum distance that could separate male and female gametophytes while still allowing fertilization to occur. Although greater spore density often resulted in higher numbers of sporophyte recruits, strong density-dependent mortality still occurred whenever there was recruitment. The requirement for spores to settle at relatively high densities (i.e., {\textgreater} 1 spore/mm2), coupled with the drastic difference in size between spores (0.01 mm) and early recruits (20 mm), insures that density-dependent mortality will occur at early stages in these algae. "Safe sites" for the recruitment of kelp were highly variable in time; recruitment of both kelps varied significantly among experiments and was negatively correlated with the natural recruitment of ephemeral species of filamentous brown algae. Differences in post- settlement mortality between Macrocystis and Pterygophora often caused patterns of spo- rophyte recruitment to vary from those of initial spore settlement. In monospecific treat- ments, the recruitment rates of the two kelps usually differed in the same experiment, indicating they responded differently to the same environmental conditions. In mixed- species treatments, interspecific competition between microscopic prerecruit stages also caused species-specific differences in early mortality. Pterygophora spore settlement gen- erally inhibited the recruitment of Macrocystis at both high (750-1500 spores/mm2) and low (10-20 spores/mm2) densities. Competition between the two kelps was asymmetrical; Macrocystis settlement had no effect on Pterygophora recruitment. Thus, changing envi- ronmental conditions and competition among early microscopic stages modified the ways in which spore settlement influenced sporophyte recruitment. The effects of these factors on kelp recruitment were interactive, and their relative importance will undoubtedly vary with species, location, and time.},

abstract = {Kelp may be useful as a bioindicator because they are primary producers that are eaten by higher trophic level organisms, including people and livestock. Often when kelp or other algae species are used as bioindicators, the whole organism is homogenized. However, some kelp can be over 25 m long from their holdfast to the tip of the blade, making it important to understand how contaminant levels vary throughout the plant. We compared the levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury and selenium in five different parts of the kelp Alaria nana to examine the variability of metal distribution. To be useful as a bioindicator, it is critical to know whether levels are constant throughout the kelp, or which part is the highest accumulator. Kelp were collected on Adak Island in the Aleutian Chain of Alaska from the Adak Harbor and Clam Cove, which opens onto the Bering Sea. In addition to determining if the levels differ in different parts of the kelp, we wanted to determine whether there were locational or size-related differences. Regression models indicated that between 14{\%} and 43{\%} of the variation in the levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, manganese, mercury, and selenium was explained by total length, part of the plant, and location (but not for lead). The main contributors to variability were length (for arsenic and selenium), location (mercury), and part of the plant (for arsenic, cadmium, chromium and manganese). The higher levels of selenium occurred at Clam Cove, while mercury was higher at the harbor. Where there was a significant difference among parts, the holdfast had the highest levels, although the differences were not great. These data indicate that consistency should be applied in selecting the part of kelp (and the length) to be used as a bioindicator. While any part of Alaria could be collected for some metals, for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and manganese a conversion should be made among parts. In the Aleutians the holdfast can be perennial while the blade, whipped to pieces by winter wave action, is regrown each year. Thus the holdfast may be used for longer-term exposure for arsenic, cadmium, chromium and manganese, while the blade can be used for short-term exposure for all metals. Cadmium, lead and selenium were at levels that suggest that predators, including people, may be at risk from consuming Alaria. More attention should be devoted to heavy metal levels in kelp and other algae from Adak, particularly where they may play a role in a subsistence diets.},

populations. Two major groupings of isolates were observable,
with ca. 70{\%} similarity between the two groups. One group
consisted of Australian, Indian, and Japanese isolates and the
other of U.S., Mexican, and African isolates. In spite of overall
high levels of genetic diversity observed in C. africana,
isolates within the two major groups were between 75 and 100{\%}
similar. The observed associations of C. africana isolates from
worldwide sources could be the result of intercontinental trade
and/or movement of seed. The data indicate that Africa was the
likely source of C. africana that has become established in the
Americas since 1996. Analysis of additional isolates in future
studies will reveal whether these groupings are being maintained
or whether population subdivision or reshuffling may occur.},

abstract = {One of the most documented generalisations in sandy beach ecology is the trend for species richness of macroinvertebrates to decrease along a morphodynamic gradient from the dissipative to the reflective condition. This widely documented pattern remains unexplained, because the responsible ecological factors and underlying biological processes are still unknown. It has been proposed that swash condition, which changes significantly along the morphodynamic gradient, is the key limiting factor underlying this biological pattern. In this study, I suggest that 2 other physical factors could also be involved: sediment grain size and erosion-accretion dynamics. This proposal is supported by a 2 yr study of 12 sandy beaches in Chile, which showed that grain size becomes coarser, erosion-accretion dynamics more intense, and swash frequency and velocity increase as morphodynamic conditions change from dissipative to reflective extremes. I propose that these 3 environmental factors, although physically interrelated, may have independent influences on different biological processes or species. I suggest therefore that the reduction of species towards the reflective extreme is caused by increasing environmental severity, which is generated by the action (of at least) the 3 physical factors mentioned above. This proposal constitutes the hypothesis of 'multicausal environmental severity', which agrees with the large interspecific variability in the life history and ecological traits of sandy beach communities, since it admits that species with different characteristics could be controlled by different limiting factors. Thus, the present hypothesis provides a more general and flexible framework for investigating the relationship between species richness and morphodynamics in sandy beaches.},

We investigated the impacts of 4 temperature treatments (11, 14, 18 and 21 degrees C) on growth, net length change and mortality of the dominant kelp species in Nova Scotia: Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata and Agarum clathratum. Growth rates of A. clathratum were reduced at 18 degrees C over 3 wk of exposure, and all species experienced negative net changes in length at this temperature. Exposure to 21 degrees C led to tissue loss at least twice that observed at 11 degrees C and mortality within the first 2 wk of exposure. Exposure to 21 degrees C for 1 wk reduced blade tissue strength (breaking stress) and extensibility (breaking strain) by 40 to 70{\%} in S. latissima and L. digitata, and all 3 species exhibited reduced strength after 3 wk exposure to 18 degrees C. Histological examination of the blade tissue showed temperature-induced damage to the cellular structure of blades of S. latissima and L. digitata. A. clathratum displayed limited tissue damage and was less susceptible to temperature-induced tissue weakening and loss. Our findings provide a mechanism by which rising temperatures could contribute to observed population declines of kelp species.},

intertidal nutrient concentrations (nitrates, nitrites,
phosphates and sili- cates), and standing stocks of different
functional-form groups of macroalgae around the South African
coast, and their relationships to consumer biomass. Clear gradi-
ents of in situ intertidal primary production and nutrient
concentrations were recorded around the South African coast,
values being highest on the west coast, intermedi- ate on the
south and lowest on the east coast. Primary production by
intertidal epilithic microalgae was corre- lated with nutrient
availability and could also be related to nearshore phytoplankton
production. The dominance patterns of different functional forms
of macroalgae changed around the coast, with foliose algae
prevalent on the west coast and coralline algae on the east
coast. However, overall macroalgal standing stocks did not re-
flect the productivity gradient, being equally high on the east
and west coasts, and low in the south. Positive rela- tionships
existed between the average biomass of inter- tidal invertebrate
consumers (grazers and filter-feeders) and intertidal
productivity, although only the grazers were directly
``connected'' to in situ production by epi- lithic intertidal
microalgae. The maximum body size of a widely distributed limpet,
Patella granularis, was also positively correlated with level of
in situ primary pro- duction. The maximal values of biomass
attained by intertidal filter-feeders were not related to
intertidal pri- mary production, and were relatively constant
around the coast. At a local scale, filter-feeder biomass is
known to be strongly influenced by wave action. This implies that
the local-scale water movements over-ride any effects that
large-scale gradients of primary production may have on
filter-feeders. The large-scale gradient in inter- tidal
productivity around the coast is thus strongly linked with grazer
biomass and individual body size, but any effect it has on
filter-feeder biomass seems subsidiary to the local effects of
wave action.},

Yet recent large-scale studies of community regulation in marine ecosystems have shown dramatically different results that leave this issue largely unresolved. We combined a multiyear, large-scale data set of species abundances for 46 species in kelp forests from the California Channel Islands with satellite-derived primary production and found that top-down control explains 7- to 10-fold more of the variance in abundance of bottom and mid-trophic levels than does bottom-up control. This top-down control was propagated via a variety of species-level direct and indirect responses to predator abundance. Management of top-down influences such as fishing may be more important in coastal marine ecosystems, particularly in kelp forest systems, than is commonly thought.},

abstract = {Abstract Analyses of hourly measurements of ocean wave heights
along the U.S. East Coast, collected since the 1970s by three
buoys of the National Data Buoy Center, document a progressive
increase during the summer months when hurricanes are most
important to wave generation. In contrast, the waves measured
during the winter, generated by extratropical storms, have not
experienced a statistically significant change. Summer waves
with significant wave heights greater than 3 m, which can be
directly attributed to specific hurricanes, have increased at a
rate of 0.059 m/y (1.8 m in 30 years) according to records from
buoy 41002 offshore from Charleston, South Carolina, with a
lower rate of 0.024 m/y (0.7 m in 30 years) recorded by the Cape
Hatteras buoy (41001); both trends are statistically significant
at the 90{\%} level. A still lower rate is found for the Cape May
buoy (44004), 0.017 m/y, suggesting that there is a systematic
latitude variation. Histograms of the ranges of significant wave
heights measured during the hurricane season show that the most
extreme occurrences during the 1996?2005 decade are both higher
and more common than occurred 30 years ago, at the beginning of
buoy measurements, having increased from about 7 m to higher
than 10 m. The waves recorded by the buoys depend on the annual
numbers of hurricanes that followed tracks northward into the
central Atlantic, how close their tracks approached the buoys,
and the intensities (categories) of those hurricanes.
Examinations of the storms that have occurred since 1980
indicate that the primary explanation for the progressive
increase in wave heights has been an intensification of the
hurricanes, with increased numbers of storms a contributing
factor.},

abstract = {Herbivory on marine macroalgae (seaweeds) in temperate areas is
often dominated by relatively small gastropods and crustaceans
(mesoherbivores). The effects of these herbivores on the
performance of adult seaweeds have so far been almost exclusively
investigated under artificial laboratory conditions. Furthermore,
several recent laboratory studies with mesoherbivores indicate
that inducible chemical resistance may be as common in seaweeds
as in vascular plants. However, in order to further explore and
test the possible ecological significance of induced chemical
resistance in temperate seaweeds, data are needed that address
this issue in natural populations. We investigated the effect of
grazing by littorinid herbivorous snails (Littorina spp.) on the
individual net growth of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum in
natural field populations. Furthermore, the capacity for induced
resistance in the seaweeds was assessed by removing herbivores
and assaying for relaxation of defences. We found that ambient
densities of gastropod herbivores significantly reduced net
growth by 45{\%} in natural field populations of A. nodosum.
Seaweeds previously exposed to grazing in the field were less
consumed by gastropod herbivores in feeding bioassays.
Furthermore, the concentration of phlorotannins (polyphenolics),
which have been shown to deter gastropod herbivores, was higher
in the seaweeds that were exposed to gastropod herbivores in the
field. This field study corroborates earlier laboratory
experiments and demonstrates that it is important to make sure
that the lack of experimental field data on marine mesoherbivory
does not lead to rash conclusions about the lack of significant
effects of these herbivores on seaweed performance. The results
strongly suggest that gastropods exert a significant selection
pressure on the evolution of defensive traits in the seaweeds,
and that brown seaweeds can respond to attacks by natural
densities of these herbivores through increased chemical
resistance to further grazing.},

transplant control, ten juvenile sporophytes of E. cava growing
in Nakagi Bay were also transplanted to the same artificial
reefs. Growth and survival rates of the sporophytes were
monitored monthly for 3 y until December 1998. The transplanted

diameter from winter to spring, whereas almost no increase was
observed from summer to autumn. However, the elongation was
greater in Nabeta sporophytes than in Nakagi sporophytes. The

lengths were similar in both Nabeta and Nakagi sporophytes from

to permanent exposure to mechanical stimulation (wind or water
movements). The adaptive value of these morphological changes

been studied extensively, particularly for higher plants
submitted to flow stress. The aim was to determine the adaptive
value of morphological patterns observed within two higher
aquatic plant species, Berula erecta and Mentha aquatica, growing
along a natural flow stress gradient. The hydrodynamic ability of
each ramet was investigated through quantitative variables (drag
coefficient and E-value). Fitness-related traits based on
vegetative growth and clonal multiplication were assessed for
each individual. For both species, the drag coefficient and the
E-value were explained only to a limited extent by the
morphological traits used. B. erecta exhibited a reduction in
size and low overall plant drag at higher flow velocities,
despite high drag values relative to leaf area, due to a low
flexibility. The plants maintained their fitness, at least in
part, through biomass reallocation: one tall ramet at low
velocity, but shorter individuals with many interconnected
stolons when flow velocity increased. For M. aquatica,
morphological differences along the velocity gradient did not
lead to greater hydrodynamic performance. Plant size increased
with increasing velocities, suggesting the indirect effects of
current favouring growth in high velocities. The fitness-related
traits did not demonstrate lower plant fitness for high
velocities. Different developmental constraints linked to plant
morphology and trade-offs between major plant functions probably
lead to different plant responses to flow stress.},

abstract = {Most solitary and colonial animals inhabiting marine hard
substrata differ fundamentally in their ability to use space.
Colonial animals are superior space competitors because (1)
indeterminate growth allows continuous lateral substratum
occupation without requiring intervening stages of sexual
reproduction and recruitment, and (2) they are less susceptible
to ``fouling'' and overgrowth. Solitary animals survive in the
seas because (1) various morphological and behavioral attributes
(escape in size, aggregative behavior) protect them in spatial
competition with colonial animals or because (2) predation,
physical disturbance, or competition with plants prevents
monopolization of substrata by colonial animals. Focus on
ecological strategies circumvents arguments regarding the
solitary or colonial identity of problematical groups such as
sponges. The evolution of specific competition mechanisms by
colonial animals has provided the basis for competitive networks
which have further favored the evolution of higher diversity
within colonial rather than solitary groups. Recognition of the
generalist-specialist and early-late ``successional'' roles of
most solitary versus colonial animals leads to predictions that
solitary animals should recruit more heavily and be more
palatable to predators than are colonial animals. Preliminary
evidence supports these predictions. Note Added in Proof.-Results
of Osman's (1977) excellent experimental study of fouling
organisms near Woods Hole, Massachusetts, unfortunately appeared
too late for inclusion here. His observations on competitive
interactions among solitary and colonial animals are in

that defences are costly. In order to investigate the potential
cost of phlorotannin production in the brown alga (kelp) Ecklonia
radiata, I measured the correlation between changes in phloro-
tannin levels and growth rates for E. radiata in two seasons,
spring and autumn. In spring, when both phlorotannin levels and
growth rates in E. radiata were highest, there was a significant
negative relationship between changes in phlorotannin levels and
growth, consistent with a cost of phlorotannin production. No
relationship was evident in autumn, indicating that moderate
levels of phlorotannins and growth could be maintained
simultaneously. These and related results suggest that the cost
of defence will vary as a function of (1) endogenous patterns of
growth or metabolite pro- duction and (2) variation in available
resources. Evi- dence for a cost of phlorotannins in E. radiata
adds to the paradox of the maintenance of high levels of
phlorotannins in Australasian brown algae. Key},

abstract = {This survey of the southernmost significant upwelling site in the Benguela Current showed that the oceanography is dominated by the seasonal wind cycle of predominant S-E winds in summer and N-W winds in winter. In the upwelling season, extending from September to March, a semi-permanent plume is isolated by a pronounced oceanic front whose position varies in the short-term and is related to wind direction. Surface waters change immediately and deeper waters more slowly to fluctuations in wind. The rate of upwelling was statistically related to wind data. A maximum rate of 32 m day -1 was found. In spring low temperature and salinity water flows northward on the shelf while between late summer and later winter oxygen-depleted water, rich in nutrients, flowed south at an estimated rate of 7-21 x 104 m s s -1 in a counter current to the Good Hope Jet. Local depletion of oxygen occurs due to phytoplankton decomposition caused, in autumn, by falling light levels and, in summer in call periods, by nitrate depletion ({\textless}1 /{\~{}}g-at N 1-1). Primary production is estimated at 3.7 kg C m -2 yr -1 with a maximum growth rate (P/max) = 17.4-19.0 mg C mg chlorophyll a -1 hr "1 and half-saturation constant (Ks) = 0.4-1.1/tg-at N 1-1. Nutrients were utilized and oxygen produced: AP:AN:ASi:AO=I:19.1 to 23.3:17.5 to 20.0:-227 to -293. High N:Si ratios (maximum 4.28) were found in oxygen-depleted water produced locally while that coming from the north had low ratios, due to resolution of silica from the sediments and nitrate reduction. The mean zooplankton standing stock, 2.3 g dry weight m -2, was 12{\%} of the phyto- plankton crop. In summer stocks were maximal 40--100 km and minimal 20-50 km from the coast while in winter they were maximal inshore. Little vertical migration occurred and the waters above the thermocline contained the majority of the population.},

In particular, we use the correlation of genes within groups within populations to define an estimator. The theoretical value of the correlation doe not depend on the number of groups in a population, and properties of the estimated correlation do not depend on the number of groups sampled or the number of individuals sampled per group. This invariance is in contrast to properties of GST. For a complete census of a population, bias and variance considerations would suggest the use of the GST-based estimator of gene flow, but lack of knowledge of population size or group number in practice suggests preference be given to the correlation-based estimator. We acknowledge that these estimators require that several conditions of a population-genetic model be met, since they do not make use of direct observations on the flow of genes. Our results differ from some of those based on simulation in a series of recent papers by M. Slatkin.},

abstract = {Temporal and spatial changes in sedimentary organic matter have
been studied in several localities of the northwest coast of
Spain. Biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter
was studied in August and September 1997 in 10 beaches subjected
to a different exposure degree to the wave action. Temporal
variations in main biochemical classes were investigated in two
of them (the more exposed and the more sheltered) over a 1-year
period from January 1997 to January 1998 every 3 months. Sediment
samples for the analysis of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates
were collected at three tidal levels: high, medium and low, when
the tide was on the ebb. Biochemical compounds concentrations
were significantly higher in the sheltered beaches than in the
exposed ones. The low hydrodynamic conditions of the sheltered
beaches favour a high accumulation of sedimentary organic matter.
There were significant differences among seasons and tidal
levels. The biopolymeric carbon (BPC, i.e. the sum of lipid,
protein and carbohydrate carbon) was dominated by proteins,
followed by lipids and carbohydrates, pointing out the no
limitation for heterotrophic metabolism in intertidal sediments.
The exposure degree to the wave action was calculated by means of
the beach slope. The relation between this parameter and the
biochemical compounds showed that localities with low slopes
(i.e. sheltered beaches) were related to high concentrations of
lipids, proteins and carbohydrates and vice versa. The three
biochemical classes showed different trends with time and changes
were more pronounced in the sheltered beach than in the exposed
one. These results could be explained by the influence of
allochthonous inputs in the sheltered beach, which were not
observed in the exposed one. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

abstract = {Macrocystis pyrifera (Giant Kelp) forests form important habitats in temperate coastal regions. Hydrodynamics control the transport of nutrients, food particles, larvae and spores at scales ranging from boundary layers around individual blades to entire kelp forests. Our measurements include vertical profiles of current and temperature, and concurrent wave measurements, at a number of different locations in and around a kelp forest at Santa Cruz, California. We find that flow at the site is dominated by variations at diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies. A vertically sheared across-shore flow, consistent with flow driven by an across-shore density gradient, is thought to be important for exchange between the kelp forest and the surrounding coastal ocean. Within the kelp forest, currents are reduced by a factor that correlates with surface canopy coverage, higher frequency internal waves are damped, and onshore transport due to waves (Stokes drift) is estimated to be similar in magnitude to that due to currents. Richardson numbers within the kelp forest are higher than those outside the kelp forest and indicate that the water column within the kelp forest is usually stable to turbulence generation by mean velocity shear.

abstract = {Many organisms occurring in temporally variable environments have evolved life-history traits that enable their populations to persist during unfavorable environmental conditions. Numerous terrestrial plants, insects, and marine invertebrates, for example, rely on resting stages that disperse their propagules in time. Although widely observed among many taxa, few examples exist for marine macroalgae, at least in part because of the methodology involved in studying them. Here, I determined that microscopic life stages of the annual marine macroalga Desmarestia ligulata overwinter during periods when the macroscopic thalli are absent, thereby allowing this species to persist in temporally variable environments. Examination of field-grown microscopic stages with fluorescence microscopy identified these stages as gametophytes. Holdfast tagging experiments determined that recruitment of the macroscopic stages was not enhanced by regrowth of perennial thalli as observed in other macroalgae, suggesting that overwintering gametophytes were the sole source of sporophyte recruitment. In contrast to true resting stages, Desmarestia gametophytes were not dormant, but rather were metabolically active, sensitive to small differences in environmental quality, and highly subject to physical damage. Gametophyte photosynthetic rates were greater under higher irradiance, and growth rates were greater under longer photoperiods and higher irradiance. Although their survival appeared to be reduced by grazing from large ({\textgreater}1 cm) invertebrates and sedimentation, gametophytes. were able to survive in the field for at least 15 mo and thereby enhance sporophyte recruitment more than a year after settlement. I suggest that Desmarestia gametophytes be regarded as alternate life-history stages that simply maintain populations under a different set of environmental conditions than the macroscopic sporophytes do, rather than as ''dormant" or "resting" stages.},

coasts are exposed, high energy shores, the east coast is a high
energy lee shore, and the northern coast from North Cape to East

the prevailing deep water wave is 3.5?4.5 m high and has a 10?12

west coast wave environment is mixed, and consists of locally
generated westerly and southerly storm waves, and swell waves
generated to the south. The prevailing wave is t.0?3.0 m and 6?8

period cycles of wave height (5 day) associated with similar
quasi?rhythmic cycles in the weather. The east coast also has a
mixed wave climate with southerly swells, originating in the
westerlies south of New Zealand, and locally generated southerly
and northerly storm waves. The prevailing wave is 0.5?2.0 m and

The following study was undertaken to make the procedures more available to the engineer working with ocean wave problems and to investigate possible ways of increasing the efficiency and the realism of the ocean wave and force simulations produced. Techniques for simulating ocean waves are most applicable when the response of the structure is complicated and perhaps involves other random environmental factors which may be introduced by concurrent simulations. The accuracy of the wave simulation is greatest for low amplitude waves and decreases for large steep waves. The degree of loss in accuracy for the higher and steeper waves deserves further research. Simulation techniques have the disadvantage of being time consuming and usually requiring the use of computers. Analytic solutions are to be preferred if feasible. Sometimes part of a problem can be solved analytically and then the intractable parts processed by simulation. A detailed search for shortcuts and approximations before proceeding with the actual simulation will often result in sizeable savings of computer time.},

direct gradient analysis, ordination, and classification - from

stability of the lower limit of kelp beds (Alaria esculenta) at
five subtidal sites in the Mingan Islands, northern Gulf of St.
Lawrence. The position of the lower limit of the beds varied
markedly among sites and over time and was largely controlled by
the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, which
formed dense (up to 500 individuals m)2) feed- ing fronts at the
lower edge of the beds. These aggregations advanced over the kelp
most rapidly during the summer (at rates as high as 2.5 m
month)1), and there appeared to be a threshold urchin biomass of
{\$}5kg m)2 below which the fronts could not substantially reduce
the limit of the beds. The fronts consisted mainly of large
individuals, whereas smaller urchins predominated in the barrens
zone be- low the kelp beds. At one site, we recorded large
seasonal shifts in overall urchin densities, with large increases
and decreases during the summer and winter, respectively. An
urchin exclusion experiment indicated that algal recruitment in
the barrens was two orders of magnitude greater in the absence
than in the presence of urchins. The kelp Agarum cribrosum
greatly re- stricted urchin movements, and the greater temporal
stability of the kelp bed at one site appeared related to the
gradual replacement of Alaria esculenta in the lower kelp bed by
a large stand of Agarum cribrosum. We propose that perturbations
by abiotic factors (e.g., ice scouring and water motion) trigger
important but localized changes in urchin densities that, in
turn, largely determine the limits of kelp bed distribution in
this region of the Atlantic where urchin barrens are a persistent

technique, AFLP, which is based on the selective amplification of
genomic restriction fragments by PCR, to differentiate bacterial
strains at the subgeneric level. In totals, 147 bacterial strains
were subjected to AFLP fingerprinting: 36 Xanthomonas strains,
including 23 pathovars of Xanthomonas axonopodis and six
pathovars of Xanthomonas vasicola, one strain of
Stenotrophomonas, 90 genotypically characterized strains
comprising all 14 hybridization groups currently described in the
genus Aeromonas, and four strains of each of the genera
Clostridium, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Vibrio.
Depending on the genus, total genomic DNA of each bacterium was
digested with a particular combination of two restriction
endonucleases and the resulting fragments were ligated to
restriction halfsite-specific adaptors. These adaptors served as
primer-binding sites allowing the fragments to be amplified by
selective PCR primers that extend beyond the adaptor and
restriction site sequences. Following electrophoretic separation
on 5{\%} (w/v) polyacrylamide/8.3 M urea, amplified products could
be visualized by autoradiography because one of the selective
primers was radioactively labelled. The resulting banding
patterns, containing approximately 30-50 visualized PCR products
in the size range 80-550 bp, were captured by a high-resolution
densitoscanner and further processed for computer-assisted
analysis to determine band-based similarity coefficients. This
study reveals extensive evidence for the applicability of AFLP in
bacterial taxonomy through comparison of the newly obtained data
with results previously obtained by well-established genotypic
and chemotaxonomic methods such as DNA-DNA hybridization and
cellular fatty acid analysis. In addition, this study clearly
demonstrates the superior discriminative power of AFLP towards
the differentiation of highly related bacterial strains that
belong to the same species or even biovar (i.e. to characterize
strains at the infrasubspecific level), highlighting the
potential of this novel fingerprinting method in epidemiological

abstract = {In this review, I summarize recent developments in marine chemical ecology and suggest additional studies that should be especially productive. Direct tests in both the field and laboratory show that secondary metabohtes commonly function as defenses against consumers. However, some metabolites also diminish fouling, inhibit competitors or microbial pathogens, and serve as gamete attractants; these alternative functions are less thoroughly investigated. We know little about how consumers perceive secondary metabolites or how ecologically realistic doses of defensive metabolites affect consumer physiology or fitness, as opposed to feeding behavior. Secondary metabolites have direct consequences, but they do not act in isolation from other prey characteristics or from the physical and biological environment in which organisms interact with their natural enemies. This mandates that marine chemical ecology be better integrated into a broader and more complex framework that includes aspects of physiological, population, community, and even ecosystem ecology. Recent advances in this area involve assessing how chemically mediated interactions are affected by physical factors such as flow, desiccation, UV radiation, and nutrient availability, or by biological forces such as the palatability or defenses of neighbors, fouling organisms, or microbial symbionts. Chemical defenses can vary dramatically among geographic regions, habitats, individuals within a local habitat, and within different portions of the same individual. Factors affecting this variance are poorly known, but include physical stresses and induction due to previous attack. Studies are needed to assess which consumers induce prey defenses, how responses vary in environments with differing physical characteristics, and whether the induced responses are a direct response to consumer attack or are a defense against microbial pathogens invading via feeding wounds. Although relatively unstudied, ontogenetic shifts in concentrations and types of defenses occur in marine species, and patterns of larval chemical defenses appear to provide insights into the evolution of complex life cycles and of differing modes of development among marine invertebrates. The chemical ecology of marine microbes is vastly underappreciated even though microbes produce metabohtes that can have devastating indirect effects on non-target organisms (e.g., red tide related fish kills) and significantly affect entire ecosystems. The natural functions of these metabolites are poorly understood, but they appear to deter both consumers and other microbes. Additionally, marine macro-organisms use metabolites from microbial symbionts to deter consumers, subdue prey, and defend their embryos from pathogens. Microbial chemical ecology offers unlimited},

The experiment compared spawning behaviour at substrata between 0.5 and 15m depth at two sites exposed to different regimes of ship-generated wave action. The total abundance of egg ribbons did not differ significantly between the two sites, but the preferred spawning depth was deeper at the wave exposed site (5m) compared to the sheltered site (2m). While water temperatures could not account for the observations, differences in wave exposure may explain the different spawning depth preferences. At both sites, large egg ribbons were generally found in deeper water, and large egg ribbons occurred more frequently at the sheltered site. Because the egg ribbons of perch are likely to have a size-dependent susceptibility to hydrodynamic stress, large females may be expected to select deeper spawning locations where the effects of surface waves are considerably attenuated.},

abstract = {Upwelling of nutrient-rich, subsurface water sustains high
productivity in the ocean's eastern boundary currents. These
ecosystems support a rate of fish harvest nearly 100 times the
global mean and account for {\textgreater}20{\%} of the world's marine fish
catch. Environmental variability is thought to be the major
cause of the decadal-scale biomass fluctuations characteristic
of fish populations in these regions, but the mechanisms
relating atmospheric physics to fish production remain
unexplained. Two atmospheric conditions induce different types
of upwelling in these ecosystems: coastal, alongshore wind
stress, resulting in rapid upwelling (with high vertical
velocity, w); and wind-stress curl, resulting in slower
upwelling (low w). We show that the level of wind-stress curl
has increased and that production of Pacific sardine (Sardinops
sagax) varies with wind-stress curl over the past six decades.
The extent of isopycnal shoaling, nutricline depth, and
chlorophyll concentration in the upper ocean also correlate
positively with wind-stress curl. The size structure of plankton
assemblages is related to the rate of wind-forced upwelling, and
sardine feed efficiently on small plankters generated by slow
upwelling. Upwelling rate is a fundamental determinant of the
biological structure and production in coastal pelagic
ecosystems, and future changes in the magnitude and spatial
gradient of wind stress may have important and differing effects
on these ecosystems. Understanding of the biological mechanisms
relating fisheries production to environmental variability is
essential for wise management of marine resources under a
changing climate.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to understand the mechanisms driving
observed subtidal variability in the stratification of Saldanha
Bay, located in the southern Benguela system. It was found that
the 6–8 day period variability in bay stratification was caused
by the inflow and outflow of cold upwelled water driven by
changing baroclinic pressure gradients between the coastal and
bay domains. The direction and magnitude of the pressure
gradients were governed by coastal upwelling activity and a lag
in the response of the bay to changes in density structure in
the coastal ocean. When the pressure gradients were bayward and
cold water was being driven into the bay the cycle was termed to
be in an `active phase' and the reverse was termed the
`relaxation phase'. The upwelling-favourable equatorward wind
stress impacted the bay stratification in two ways: on the
regional scale, wind drives upwelling and governs the
inflow–outflow of cold upwelled bottom water, which strengthens
stratification; conversely, on the local bay scale, wind drives
vertical mixing, which weakens stratification. A four-phase
model is used to describe the observed variability in
stratification in the bay. The associated density-driven
exchange flows are capable of flushing the bay in 6–8 days,
about one-third of the time for tidal exchange alone (c. 25
days). These inflows of cold bottom water are ecologically
critical as they supply nutrients to the bay and thus impose a
control on new production within the bay environment. Further
ecological implications of this bay–ocean exchange include
export of phytoplankton new production to the coast, limitation
of the risk of harmful algal blooms (HABs) and the division of
the system into two distinct ecosystems (bay and lagoon).},

Feeding rates by two size groups (mean test diameter = 53 and 80 mm) were measured for rehydrated dried blades and fresh live thalli of kelp Laminaria spp. Feeding rate of the larger sea urchins was markedly reduced at the peak velocity of 0.3 m/s and virtually ceased beyond ???0.40 m/s. The peak velocities at which feeding rate began to decrease and reached almost nil were somewhat lower for the smaller sea urchins than for the larger ones. The velocity limit for feeding does not appear to be a function of temperature. Movement by sea urchins was reduced to half the rate in still water at the peak velocity of 0.30-0.40 m/s. Sea urchins could hardly move beyond 0.70 m/s. The depth variation in the mean of the wave-induced significant peak bottom water velocity, predicted from 6-yr offshore wave data available on the northeastern Pacific coast of Honshu, Japan, was consistent with depth distributions of S. nudus and kelp. The predicted frequency of the significant peak velocity {\textless}0.40 m/s, in which sea urchin grazing might be possible, was as high as 70{\%} at 12 m depth but was only 3{\%} at 2 m depth.

More taxa were found by PQs than by VTs, both overall and on a per quadrat basis. VTs tended to overestimate the percent cover of rock and articulated coralline algae. VTs were incapable of resolving many of the less common red algae. Video sampling required less time in the field than point quadrats but laboratory analysis was very time consunling. Lack of resolution and extensive laboratory analysis make this technique insufficient for sampling benthic red algal populations. However, VTs may be useful in documenting large-scale differences between regions, such as the percent cover of understory kelps or the density of large mobile invertebrates in central California kelp forests. Video sampling has been successfully used in the intertidal but traditional, random point quadrats std appear to be the most efficient and accurate way to sample benthlc communities in kelp forests.},

abstract = {Sunken parcels of macroalgae and wood provide important oases of organic enrichment at the deep-sea floor, yet sediment community structure and succession around these habitat islands are poorly evaluated. We experimentally implanted 100-kg kelp falls and 200 kg wood falls at 1670 m depth in the Santa Cruz Basin to investigate (1) macrofaunal succession and (2) species overlap with nearby whale-fall and cold-seep communities over time scales of 0.25-5.5 yr. The abundance of infaunal macrobenthos was highly elevated after 0.25 and 0.5 yr near kelp parcels with decreased macrofaunal diversity and evenness within 0.5 m of the falls. Apparently opportunistic species (e.g., two new species of cumaceans) and sulfide tolerant microbial grazers (dorvilleid polychaetes) abounded after 0.25-0.5 yr. At wood falls, opportunistic cumaceans become abundant after 0.5 yr, but sulfide tolerant species only became abundant after 1.8-5.5 yr, in accordance with the much slower buildup of porewater sulfides at wood parcels compared with kelp falls. Species diversity decreased significantly over time in sediments adjacent to the wood parcels, most likely due to stress resulting from intense organic loading of nearby sediments (up to 20-30{\%} organic carbon). Dorvilleid and ampharetid polychaetes were among the top-ranked fauna at wood parcels after 3.0-5.5 yr. Sediments around kelp and wood parcels provided low-intensity reducing conditions that sustain a limited chemoautrotrophically-based fauna. As a result, macrobenthic species overlap among kelp, wood, and other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep NE Pacific are primarily restricted to apparently sulfide tolerant species such as dorvilleid polychaetes, opportunistic cumaceans, and juvenile stages of chemosymbiont containing vesicomyid bivalves. We conclude that organically enriched sediments around wood falls may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and evolution of species dependent on organic- and sulfide-rich conditions at the deep-sea floor and contribute to ?? and ?? diversity in deep-sea ecosystems. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. Macrophytes in running waters experience an often dynamic and
harsh environment. To avoid breakage, plants have to reduce the
experienced drag force. However, by reducing leaf area,
photosynthetic production is less. Aquatic plants therefore have
to find a balance between reducing drag and maintaining
photosynthetic capacity. 2. In the experiments in this study, we
assessed to what extent different morphological strategies
(emergent vs. submerged) were able to minimize drag while
maximizing leaf area. 3. From our measurements, it is clear that
with increasing water velocities, emergent plant species have a
drag value three to four times higher than submerged species. 4.
To test the versatility of leaves, leaves were removed and their
effect on drag and bending was investigated. Almost 60{\%} of the
drag is contributed by the leaves, and stems bend less when
leaves are removed. 5. Because high submerged leaf area increases
not only plant drag but also photosynthetic yield, a trade-off
between both parameters was investigated in the function of
stream velocity. Emerged species had a more favourable trade-off
at low stream velocities. However, with increasing stream
velocity, submerged species could reduce their drag more in
comparison with blunt objects. Within these submerged species, a
clear distinction was seen between those ( Pota - mogeton natans)
concentrating their leaf area on or just beneath the water
surface ( Stuckenia pectinata) and those with more or less evenly
distributed biomass ( Callitriche platycarpa and Ranunculus
penicillatus). 6. These results indicate that aquatic plants with
an emergent strategy are able to take better advantage of zones
with reduced hydraulic forces than submerged plants.
Additionally, this plant occurrence will be determined by the
relationship between total plant drag and root strength.

identification, benthic organisms were identified twice, first in
the field and later from video images. These identifications were
then compared. The effect of observer error on precision of
benthic cover estimates was examined by having 2 observers sample
the same video images on 3 separate occasions. These estimates
were then compared at the level of different benthic groups (hard
coral, soft coral and algae) and for different hierarchical
levels of classification of hard corals (life form, family, genus

'families of hard coral' (91 +/- 7{\%}) were identified most
accurately and least variably from video images, although many
genera and some distinctive species were also identified
reliably. Life forms of hard corals proved to be the least
accurate and most variable level of classification, with a mean
accuracy rating of 74 +/- 16{\%}. There was little additional
variation in estimates of cover when 2 trained observers sampled
images, compared with variation in estimates of cover from
repeated samples of images by a single observer. At 10{\%} cover,
variability in estimates made by a single observer resulted in
mean CIs of 7.9 to 12.1{\%}. Inclusion of variation between
observers expanded CIs by only +/-0.22{\%}. Furthermore, total

Norwegian coast and there is a need to obtain better knowledge on
the possible consequences of this harvesting. Experiments were
run with irregular waves over a sloping bottom, and a kelp field
was simulated by 5000 artificial kelp plants in a 1:10 scale. The
experiments primarily focused on the effect of kelp upon erosion
of a sand dune, wave damping and water velocities. It was found
that the water level is a very important factor to the degree of
dune erosion, while the kelp has only a minor effect. The kelp
does, however, cause significant wave damping and the degree of
wave breaking is reduced. It was also found that the kelp
modifies the water velocity profile. In a region above the kelp
canopy layer, the time-averaged water velocity was shoreward,
while the seaward undertow was confined to a region higher up in
the water column.},

abstract = {Experiments in a central California Macrocystis pyrifera (L.)
C.A. Agardh forest examined the effects of long-term (six year)
kelp canopy exclusion on the abundance of the annual brown alga
Desmarestia ligulata (Light F). Exclusion of both surface and
subsurface kelp canopies from replicate clearings within
stillwater Cove, CA, USA showed that D. ligulata sporophyte
recruitment is opportunistic, with more sporophytes occurring in
areas where canopies were excluded than under control canopies.
Kelp canopy exclusion also increased spring and summer bottom
irradiances, and resulted in a steady increase of perennial turf
algae over the six-year study. This, in turn, led to a decrease
in the availability of nongeniculate coralline algae (the primary
substratum on which D. ligulata recruits). Subsequently, the
annual maximum abundance of D. ligulata sporophytes decreased in
the Canopy clearings, but did not change under control canopies.
Removal of turf algae from experimental plots further increased
bottom irradiances and significantly enhanced D. ligulata
recruitment. When released from apparent competition for light
and space, D. ligulata sporophytes exhibited an annual life
history, with recruitment occurring during a two-week period
(April 4- April 17) in the spring, and maximum bottom cover
occurring in the summer (July). The onset of Desmarestia
sporophyte recruitment was closely associated with seasonal
increases in daylength and rapid decreases in ocean temperature.
These results indicate that the Desmarestia sporophyte life
history is both annual and opportunistic, with the onset of
recruitment stimulated by predictable, seasonal changes in
environmental conditions, and the magnitude of recruitment
modified by stochastic processes that affect the availability of
light and space. Comparison of these results with those from
similar studies indicate that they are robust and suggest that
they may be generalized over broad temporal and spatial scales.},

abstract = {Summary This paper describes the development of a new set of
equations derived from 1D shallow water theory for use in 2D
storage cell inundation models where flows in the x and y
Cartesian directions are decoupled. The new equation set is
designed to be solved explicitly at very low computational cost,
and is here tested against a suite of four test cases of
increasing complexity. In each case the predicted water depths
compare favourably to analytical solutions or to simulation
results from the diffusive storage cell code of Hunter et al.
(2005). For the most complex test involving the fine spatial
resolution simulation of flow in a topographically complex urban
area the Root Mean Squared Difference between the new
formulation and the model of Hunter et al. is ∼1cm. However,
unlike diffusive storage cell codes where the stable time step
scales with (1/$\Delta$x)2, the new equation set developed here
represents shallow water wave propagation and so the stability
is controlled by the Courant–Freidrichs–Lewy condition such that
the stable time step instead scales with 1/$\Delta$x. This allows use
of a stable time step that is 1–3 orders of magnitude greater
for typical cell sizes than that possible with diffusive storage
cell models and results in commensurate reductions in model run
times. For the tests reported in this paper the maximum speed up
achieved over a diffusive storage cell model was 1120×, although
the actual value seen will depend on model resolution and water
surface gradient. Solutions using the new equation set are shown
to be grid-independent for the conditions considered and to have
an intuitively correct sensitivity to friction, however small
instabilities and increased errors on predicted depth were noted
when Manning's n=0.01. The new equations are likely to find
widespread application in many types of flood inundation
modelling and should provide a useful additional tool, alongside
more established model formulations, for a variety of flood risk
management studies.},

were Cape Agulhas, West and East Agulhas Bank, Mossel Bay to Port
Elizabeth, and Port Alfred. The overall recapture rate was
7.51{\%}, with individuals remaining at large for up to 10.3 yr.
Overall, 547 (25.8{\%}) tagged lobsters of both sexes moved {\textgreater}20 km
within or between sites. We hypothesized that counter-current
migration of juveniles would occur to redress downstream
dispersal of phyllosoma larvae by the westerly flowing Agulhas
Current. The vast majority of migrants (72.6{\%}) did prove to be
immature (carapace length 50 km, either southeastwards offshore
to the West and East Agulhas Bank sites (106 lobsters, covering a
mean distance of 154 km), or eastwards alongshore to the Mossel
Bay to Port Elizabeth site near the center of the range (33
lobsters, 461 km). The fastest 5{\%} of migrants moved at 0.43 to
0.78 km d–1. In general, Cape Agulhas migrants reached West
Agulhas Bank within 1 yr, East Agulhas Bank within 2, and Mossel
Bay to Port Elizabeth within 3 yr. The West Agulhas Bank
population comprised mostly juveniles and small mature
individuals, and 38{\%} migrated, all moving eastwards, either to
East Agulhas Bank (66 lobsters, 46 km), or to Mossel Bay to Port
Elizabeth (73 lobsters, 426 km). The easterly migration of P.
gilchristi was evident but diminished at East Agulhas Bank,
virtually absent at Mossel Bay to Port Elizabeth and non-existent
at Port Alfred (at the eastern extreme). There was no evidence
suggesting a westwards or return migration at any of the 5 sites.
It is concluded that Cape Agulhas is an important settlement area
for post-larvae originating between Port Elizabeth and West
Agulhas Bank, and that juveniles migrate eastwards to redress the
downstream displacement. The Port Alfred population is
non-migratory and receives no immigrants from elsewhere, adding
to other evidence that it is a separate stock, and it is inferred
that phyllosoma larvae from this area use a different larval
dispersal and return mechanism.},

Bottom-mounted apparatus at Robin Hood's Bay and Flamborough Head (Yorkshire, England) has been used to study fluctuations in sediment deposition. Membrane filtration of sea water has given data on suspended material. The total dry weight of deposited sediment has been related to prevailing onshore winds (in excess of 6.6 m/sec) and turbulence. The coarseness of the sediment deposited is proportional to the total sample dry weight. Sediment sorting is shown to vary according to the relative contribution of the particle size range incorporating a median diameter of 180 ??m. 'Organic' content of deposited sediment fluctuated seasonally, with highest values after the settlement of detritus during periods of summer calm. Suspended solids showed a marked seasonal variation with high values in winter and low values in summer. Statistical analysis, has enabled a grouping of months into two significantly different periods, i.e. 'summer' and 'winter' to be made. A generally comparable seasonal trend in suspended solids has been observed over a two year period. A multiple linear regression equation is presented, linking suspended solids at Robin Hood's Bay with the environmental parameters of sea state, tidal range, and river flow: the regression accounts for 28 {\%} of the total variance. Sea state is shown to be the single most important factor influencing suspended solids. The ecological significance of the environmental complex governing the expression of a 'sediment factor' is discussed in relation to the kelp fauna. The difficulty of accurately interpreting data on faunal dynamics is outlined in the light of these and other factors. The suggestion is made that such data would be of little use in an assessment of temporally changing pollution effects. ?? 1972.},

abstract = {Ecklonia radiata (C. Ag.) J. Agardh is a common macroalga on reefs in the warm-temperate parts of the southern hemisphere. It is a dominant habitatformer and as such has a strong structuring effect on associated algal assemblages. Morphological variation in E. radiata potentially affects its interactions with the surroundings and contributes to confusion about its taxonomy. We quantified the magnitude of morphological variation in fully developed E. radiata sporophytes across Australasia and tested the hypotheses that E. radiata has different morphology at different locations and that the degree of morphological difference depends on spatial distances among locations. A total of 11 morphological characters were sampled from 11 locations along the Australian coastline from Kalbarri in Western Australia to Sydney in New South Wales as well as from Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. Most morphological characters varied considerably from one location to another. For example, the average (±SE) thallus length was 135.2±12.5 cm in Kalbarri and only 69.7±5.5 cm in Sydney. There were no consistent spatial patterns of variation among individual morphological characters, and, generally, variations among individual characters were poorly correlated ()0.5 {\textless}R{\textless}0.5). This suggests that individual morphological characters develop independently of each other in response to processes operating at different spatial scales. Multivariate measures of morphology were found to be different among some locations and similar among others ()0.37 {\pounds} Clarke's R {\pounds} 1), but there was no correlation (Spearman's R=0.08) between morphological similarity and distance between locations. Consequently, our results do not support clinal variation in E. radiata morphology. Rather, they suggest the presence of discrete morphologically different populations, in which the morphology at any one location reflects multiple forcing factors operating on different morphological characters at different spatial scales.},

yield estimates of the combination of parameters (the number of
migrants [Nm] in a demic model or the neighborhood size [4irDa2]

gene flow and genetic drift. We review the theory underlying
these methods and derive new analytic results for the expectation
of FST in stepping-stone and continuum models when small sets of

different methods using a variety of simulated data. We found
that the FST and rare-alleles methods yield comparable estimates
under a wide variety of conditions when the population being
sampled is demographically stable. They are roughly equally
sensitive to selection and to variation in population structure,
and they approach their equilibrium values at approximately the
same rate. We found that two different maximum-likelihood methods
tend to yield biased estimates when relatively small numbers of
locations are sampled but more accurate estimates when larger
numbers are sampled. Our con- clusion is that, although FST and
rare-alleles methods are expected to be equally effective in
analyzing ideal data, practical problems in estimating the

that FST is likely to be more useful under realistic conditions.},

abstract = {The giant kelp Macrocystis is the world's largest benthic
organism and most widely distributed kelp taxon, serving as the
foundation for diverse and energy-rich habitats that are of great
ecological and economical importance. Although the basic and
applied literature on Macro- cystis is extensive and
multinational, studies of large Macrocystis forests in the
northeastern Pacific have received the greatest attention. This
review synthesises the existing Macrocystis literature into a
more global perspective. During the last 20 yr, the primary
literature has shifted from descriptive and experimental studies
of local Macrocystis distribution, abundance and population and
commu- nity structure (e.g., competition and herbivory) to
comprehensive investigations of Macrocystis life history,
dispersal, recruitment, physiology and broad-scale variability in
population and community processes. Ample evidence now suggests
that the genus is monospecific. Due to its highly variable
physiology and life history, Macrocystis occupies a wide variety
of environments (intertidal to 60+ m, boreal to warm temperate)
and sporophytes take on a variety of morphological forms.
Macrocystis sporophytes are highly responsive to environmental
variability, resulting in differential population dynamics and
effects of Macrocystis on its local environment. Within the large
subtidal giant kelp forests of southern California, Macrocystis
sporophytes live long, form extensive surface canopies that shade
the substratum and dampen currents, and produce and retain
copious amounts of reproductive propagules. The majority of
subtidal Macrocystis populations worldwide, however, are small,
narrow, fringing forests that are productive and modify
environmental resources (e.g., light), yet are more dynamic than
their large southern California counterparts with local
recruitment probably resulting from remote propagule production.
When intertidal, Macrocystis populations exhibit vegetative
propagation. Growth of high-latitude Macrocystis sporophytes is
seasonal, coin- cident with temporal variability in insolation,
whereas growth at low latitudes tracks more episodic variability
in nutrient delivery. Although Macrocystis habitat and energy
provision varies with such ecotypic variability in morphology and
productivity, the few available studies indicate that Macrocystis
-associated communities are universally diverse and productive.
Furthermore, temporal and spatial variability in the structure
and dynamics of these systems appears to be driven by processes
that regulate Macrocystis distribution, abundance and
productivity, rather than the con- sumptive processes that make
some other kelp systems vulnerable to overexploitation. This
global synthesis suggests that the great plasticity in
Macrocystis form and function is a key determinant of},

abstract = {Abstract A two-dimensional numerical model is used to study the
response to upwelling- and downwelling-favorable winds on a
shelf with a strong pycnocline. During upwelling or downwelling,
the pycnocline intersects the surface or bottom, forming a front
that moves offshore. The characteristics of the front and of the
inner shelf inshore of the front are quite different for
upwelling and downwelling. For a constant wind stress the
upwelling front moves offshore at roughly a constant rate, while
the offshore displacement of the downwelling front scales as t
because the thickness of the bottom layer increases as the front
moves offshore. The geostrophic alongshelf transport in the
front is larger during downwelling than upwelling for the same
wind stress magnitude because the geostrophic shear is near the
bottom in downwelling as opposed to near the surface in
upwelling. During upwelling, weak stratification is maintained
over the inner shelf by the onshore flux of denser near-bottom
water. This weak stratification suppresses vertical mixing,
causing a small reduction in stress at mid depth that drives a
weak cross-shelf circulation over the inner shelf. For constant
stratification, the inner shelf stratification and cross-shelf
circulation are stronger. During downwelling on an initially
stratified shelf, the inner shelf becomes unstratified because
the very weak cross-shelf circulation forces lighter water under
denser, driving convection which enhances the vertical mixing.
As a result the stress is nearly constant throughout the water
column and the cross-shelf circulation is slightly weaker than
in the initially unstratified case. The downwelling response is
essentially the same for the constant stratification and the
two-layer cases. Model runs including the evolution of a passive
tracer indicate that the inner shelf region acts as a barrier to
cross-shelf transport of tracers from the coastal boundary to
farther offshore and vice versa, due to strong vertical mixing
and weak cross-shelf circulation in this region.},

abstract = {Much current research on community ecology concerns indirect effects, cas- cading trophic interactions, and the role of top-down vs. bottom-up processes, as well as subsidization of matter and energy between different systems. We addressed all these topics by exploring interactions between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and both recruits and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae, in the light of the fact that juvenile abalone shelter beneath the urchins. In field experiments at six sites, urchins were eliminated from removal plots to determine the degree to which juvenile abalone (individuals 3-35 mm in length) depend upon urchins. Comparisons were made with undisturbed and disturbance-control plots. We hypothesized that after removal of urchins: (1) there would be an immediate decline of juvenile abalone, since they are intimately associated with the urchins; (2) abalone recruits (recent settlers {\textless}3 mm in length) would be unlikely to suffer immediately or directly because, unlike juveniles, they are only weakly associated with the urchins; (3) foliar algae would proliferate due to decreased grazing by urchins; (4) there would be a consequent reduction in crustose coralline algae due to overgrowth by foliar algae; and (5) the decline of crustose corallines would reduce recruitment of abalone due to a loss of settlement and nursery habitat. In urchin-removal plots, juvenile abalone declined dramatically, becoming virtually extinct locally. Their disappearance was slowest in crevices compared with exposed habitats, but even there they failed to survive longer than five months. Contrary to expec- tations, abalone recruits also disappeared from urchin-removal plots, possibly because the cover of sediment almost doubled there. Also contrary to our hypotheses, neither foliar macroalgae nor encrusting corallines responded to urchin removal. The explanation of these results is that P. angulosus was able to gather drift kelp when this food source was available, rather than acting as an active grazer. This feeding pattern has profound consequences and explains why urchins failed to influence algal community composition. By sheltering be- neath urchins, juvenile abalone gain protection from predators and may also benefit from an enhanced food supply. Bottom-up subsidization of urchins by drift kelp is thus respon- sible for the feeding behavior of the urchins, and indirectly facilitates their role in harboring juvenile abalone. This role is of immense importance for the lucrative abalone fishery, and depletion of urchins could lead to a collapse of abalone populations. Human exploitation of top predators that consume urchins, such as rock lobsters and some fishes, has conceivably exaggerated the role of urchins in sustaining juvenile abalone.},

abstract = {Current and wave properties were studied in the semi-protected waters of the San Juan Archipelago, Washington, at 6 shallow subtidal sites chosen to include a wide range of variability in exposure to both tidal currents and waves. Within each site, 4 to 6 plots measuring roughly 50 to 100 m(2) each were established on nearly horizontal rock platforms at mean depths ranging from 6.1 to 11.0 m, with most plots at mean depths of 7.0 to 9.2 m. Plots were established nominally to minimize within-site variability in hydrodynamics, and were locations of several species of kelp (reported in a companion paper). For more than a year replicate measurements of flow and pressure (mean depth and wave signals) were collected at all sites in 2 Hz bursts 25 cm above the substratum, a height relative to understory kelps, providing a unique, detailed spatial and temporal characterization of a shallow subtidal hydrodynamic regime pertinent to these plants. Despite the intended similarity of plots within sites, local-flow microhabitat remained substantial at scales relative to understory plants, and largely ameliorated differences in tidal signals among most sites. Greater than 50{\%} of the spatial variability in maximum tidal current speed, and 31 to 44{\%} of the variance in the duration of periods of calm flow (speeds consistently {\textless}20 cm s(-1)), occurred within sites at scales of meters, and not at the larger (km) scales that separated sites. In contrast, wave effects at 7 to 11 m depth were predictable spatially. Significant wave impacts were recorded only at 2 sites characterized by a large, open fetch. Wave-dominated flows were recorded by replicate sensors multiple times within both of these sites, and the strongest instantaneous wave speeds approached 150 to 200 cm s(-1). Maximum wave-generated speeds recorded just above the substratum at these 2 sites were similar to2 to 3x maximum tidal currents. These results help to explain patterns noted in concurrent studies of the population dynamics and morphology of several species of kelp.},

Australia provides an unparalleled opportunity to address such questions because it has three replicate boundary currents within narrow latitudinal ranges that share continentally distributed species. We tested whether the strength of continental boundary currents influences coastal connectivity of a dominant foundation species (the kelp Ecklonia radiate). 3. Variation in the strength of different boundary currents produced entirely different patterns of connectivity in kelp with high connectivity in strong currents and low connectivity in weak currents. Spatial patterns of genetic structuring were also correlated with the nature and strength of currents. 4. Synthesis.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The protection of biodiversity is one of the most
important goals in terrestrial and marine conservation. Marine
conservation approaches have traditionally followed the example
of terrestrial initiatives. However, patterns, processes,
habitats, and threats differ greatly between the 2 systems — and
even within the marine environment. As a result, there is still a
lack of congruence as to how to best identify and prioritize
conservation approaches moving from the static terrestrial and
nearshore realm into a more fluid, 3-dimensional pelagic realm.
To address this problem, we investigate how the conservation
science literature has been used to inform and guide management
strategies in the marine system from coastal to pelagic
environments. As cumulative impacts on the health of the oceans
continue to increase, conservation priorities have shifted to
include highly dynamic areas of the pelagic marine system. By
evaluating whether priorities match science with current
place-based management approaches (i.e. marine protected areas,
MPAs), we identify important gaps that must be considered in
current conservation schemes. Effective pelagic MPA design
requires monitoring and evaluation across multiple physical,
biological, and human dimensions. Because many threatened and
exploited marine species move through an ephemeral and
ever-changing environment, our results highlight the need to move
beyond traditional, 2-dimensional approaches to marine
conservation, and into dynamic management approaches that
incorporate metrics of biodiversity as well as oceanographic
features known to promote multilevel, trophic productivity},

transplants in the field and lab remained similar to individuals
from the original collection location, regardless of the imposed

correlated with morphology. Based on bump heights and water
velocities in the field, bullate blades could increase turbulent
transport of nutrients 4-fold that of flat blades. The thicker
blades and large holdfasts of the flat morph may impart higher
survivorship under high-flow conditions. This suggests water
motion selects for 2 distinct morphotypes of E. arborea that
represent adaptations to enhance fitness under different nutrient
availability and drag force regimes. Thus, blade morphology is
not a plastic response to the local environment but a genetically

There are two problems that are a priority to be resolved:
microbe contamination from urban sources and over-enrichment by
nutrients from agricultural sources. This paper deals with the
non-market value which local people give to water quality in the
harbour. Our objectives are to improve the knowledge about the
demand for natural assets in France, and, simultaneously, to
prepare a cost-benefit analysis which will aid decision-making
concerning the restoration of the harbour. In an on site survey
carried out in summer 1993, we developed a contingent valuation
for two goods: (1) improved water salubrity, and (2)
preservation of the ecosystem against eutrophication. The
corresponding willingness to pay (WTP) values were explained
using Tobit models. Whatever the good, the WTP was seen to rise
with revenue. However, whilst the WTP ««salubrity»» was affected
by environmental sensibility and awareness of local pollution,
it is education above all which affected the WTP ««ecosystem»».
On the whole, residents accepted the exercise of contingent
valuation and were willing to give important amounts (FF 215 and
FF 160 on average per household per year, respectively, for
goods 1 and 2). The differences between the goods and the

abstract = {Abstract:Floating seaweeds are important dispersal vehicles,
especially for organisms with limited movement capacities and
for the seaweeds themselves. The persistence of floating
seaweeds is determined by the balance between their acclimation
potential and the environmental pressures at the sea surface.
Solar radiation is the most important inducer of physiological
stress, varying in intensity throughout the day and the year.
Therefore photoinhibition and subsequent recovery can change
depending on the daily radiation dose and season. The bull kelp
Durvillaea antarctica is one of the most common floating
seaweeds in the southern oceans, including New Zealand, Chile,
and most subantarctic islands. Herein, daily cycles of maximum
quantum yield (Fv/Fm), photoinhibition and recovery levels were
examined in microcosm experiments with floating D. antarctica
throughout the year, focusing on the blade side exposed to solar
radiation (sunny vs shadow side). Also, the effect of simulated
wave action (blade turnover) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on
photoinhibition and recovery of Fv/Fm was evaluated. Significant
differences in maximum quantum yield were observed between blade
sides, with lowest values on the sun-exposed side, especially
during noontime and spring/summer months. Phlorotannins and
pigments were measured during seasons with the most intense
solar radiation (late spring, early summer), when Fv/Fm values
were lowest. Phlorotannin, but not pigment concentrations,
differed between sunny (lower concentration) and shadow blade
sides (higher concentration) and throughout the daily cycle.
Both blade sides had similar photoinhibition and recovery levels
when blades were constantly turned over. Absence of UVR favoured
the recovery capacity of Fv/Fm in both blade sides, suggesting
that the photorecovery potential of floating kelps depends on
the environmental conditions that kelp rafts face at the sea
surface (e.g. cloudy vs sunny days, intense seawater movement
and splashing vs calm sea conditions). The results confirm that
photobiological stress is more severe during summer and on
continuously sun-exposed blade sides, thereby damaging the
blades and suppressing the floating time of D. antarctica.},

the density and size of gametophytes of the habitat- forming kelp
Ecklonia radiata, across its Australian distribution (between {\~{}}9°

thermal optima for performance. Optimum temperatures in warmer
regions were more than 1°C higher than in cooler regions.
Biogeographically, the thermal optima for gametophytes were more
strongly linked to long-term temperature characteristics of a
region (annual extremes, 3 yr range) than short-term variation
(mean for the month prior) in sea temper- ature. These results
document that present-day populations of E. radiata have adjusted
their gametophyte thermal sensitivity according to their local
environment, and further indicate that these differences are
adaptive rather than phenotypic. Collectively, these findings
suggest that the scope for thermal adaptation and gametophyte
performance of E. radiata across most of its Australian

We investigated whether naturally occurring $\delta$(13)C patterns among amino acids ($\delta$(13)CAA) could distinguish between multiple aquatic and terrestrial primary production sources. We found that $\delta$(13)CAA patterns in contrast to bulk $\delta$(13)C values distinguished between carbon derived from algae, seagrass, terrestrial plants, bacteria and fungi. Furthermore, we showed for two aquatic producers that their $\delta$(13)CAA patterns were largely unaffected by different environmental conditions despite substantial shifts in bulk $\delta$(13)C values. The potential of assessing the major carbon sources at the base of the food web was demonstrated for freshwater, pelagic, and estuarine consumers; consumer $\delta$(13)C patterns of essential amino acids largely matched those of the dominant primary producers in each system. Since amino acids make up about half of organismal carbon, source diagnostic isotope fingerprints can be used as a new complementary approach to overcome some of the limitations of variable source bulk isotope values commonly encountered in estuarine areas and other complex environments with mixed aquatic and terrestrial inputs.},

abstract = {Mechanisms of high-temperature tolerance in the kelp Laminaria
saccharina (L.) Lamour, were examined by comparing a
heat-tolerant ecotype from Long Island Sound (LIS), New York, and
a population from the Atlantic (ATL) coast of Maine. Greater heat
tolerance was not attributable to greater thermal stability of
the photosynthetic apparatus: LIS and ATL plants exhibited
similar short-term effects of high temperature on photosynthetic
capacity (P-max) and quantum yield (estimated as the ratio of
variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence, F-v/F-m). As LIS
plants had consistently higher N and protein content than ATL
plants, the interaction between nitrogen nutrition and
high-temperature tolerance was examined. When grown under high N
supply and optimal temperature (12 degrees C), LIS plants had a
higher density of photosystem II reaction centers (RCII), higher
activity of two Calvin cycle enzymes (ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase [RUBISCO] and NADP-dependent
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [G3PDH]), and higher
P-max and F-v/F-m than ATL plants. Individual ATL plants,
furthermore, exhibited close correlations of RCII density and
enzyme activity with N and/or protein content. Variation in RCII
density and enzyme activity, in turn, largely accounted for
plant-to-plant differences in P-max and F-v/F-m. Relationships
among these parameters were generally weak or lacking among
individual LIS plants grown under optimal conditions, apparently
because luxury N consumption resulted in excess reserves of
photosynthetic apparatus components. Exposure of N-replete LIS
and ATL plants to a superoptimal temperature (22 degrees C) for 4
days caused an increase in the minimum turnover time of the
photosynthetic apparatus (tau) and a decrease in P-max, but had
no consistent effect on F-v/F-m, RCII density, PSU size
(chlorophyll a/RCII), or enzyme activities. When plants were
subjected to concurrent N limitation and heat stress, however,
LIS and ATL populations exhibited quite different responses. All
photosynthetic parameters of N-limited ATL plants declined
sharply in response to high temperature, resulting in a negative
rate of daily net C fixation. In contrast, LIS plants showed a
reduction in PSU size, but maintained other parameters, including
daily C fixation, at levels similar to those of N-limited plants
at optimal temperature. Overall, the ability of LIS plants to
accumulate and maintain high N reserves appears to be critical
for heat tolerance and, therefore, for survival during summer
periods of simultaneous low N supply and superoptimal
temperature. ATL plants, which also experience low summer N
supply but not superoptimal temperatures, do not accumulate large
reserves of nitrogenous components and are unable to tolerate the
combined stress. Because low N supply often co-occurs with high
temperatures in temperature marine systems, large-scale declines
in algal productivity, such as during El Nino events, are
probably due to the interactive effect of N limitation and heat
stress.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter examines the patch dynamics of
Macrocystis in Southern California from a metapopulation
perspective and begins by synthesizing existing and new
information pertaining to the metapopulation structure and
dynamics of Macrocystis in the Southern California Bight. The
biological and physical factors that affect colonization are
reviewed, and a new empirical and theoretical estimate of spore
dispersal distance for varying oceanic conditions is presented.
The average kelp bed in Southern California appears to be
connected to one to three neighboring kelp beds via spore
dispersal for a relatively wide range of oceanographic
conditions. More importantly, connectivity, even among nearby
patches, seems to be mediated by spores that travel far beyond
the median dispersal distance. The persistence of a giant kelp
metapopulation depends on the tails of the dispersal curve and
cannot be predicted simply from the average or median dispersal
distance. Patch size, fecundity, and proximity to neighboring
patches undoubtedly exert strong influences on the level of
connectivity among patches. Compared with many terrestrial
habitats, the aqueous medium through which kelp propagules
disperse is relatively unstructured. Moreover, unlike passively
dispersed kelp spores and drifters, immigrants in many
terrestrial metapopulations exhibit complex behavioral
interactions with the heterogenous landscape that influence
connectivity between patches. The strong dependence of giant
kelp connectivity and patch dynamics on environmental factors,
such as geomorphology and oceanography, suggests that the
metapopulation structure of this species is likely to differ
substantially among regions.},

East China Sea in spring. Young individuals of the yellowtail
Seriola quinqueradiata are captured for aquaculture purposes

important during the late winter to early spring, which

field surveys using R/V Tansei-Maru were conducted in the

winter to early spring in 2010 and 2011. We obtained positions
of the vessel by GPS and transversal distances from the vessel
to a raft by visual observation. Distance sampling method
(Thomas et al. 2010) was applied to estimation of floating
seaweed densities (rafts km-2). Seaweed rafts were also randomly
sampled using nets during the research cruises. In the East
China Sea, seaweed rafts were distributed mainly on the
continental shelf west of the Kuroshio, especially in waters
between 26° N and 30° N. Collected rafts consisted of only one
species, Sargassum horneri (Turner) C. Agardh. Taking into
account surface currents and geographical distribution of S.
horneri, it is estimated that these floating seaweeds originated
from natural beds along the coast between mid and south China.
Considering the approximate travel times, it is suggested that
floating patches are colonized by yellowtails early on during
their trips, i.e., close to the Chinese coast.},

abstract = {Global climate change is shifting species distributions worldwide. At rear edges (warmer, low latitude range margins), the consequences of small variations in environmental conditions can be magnified, producing large negative effects on species ranges. A major outcome of shifts in distributions that only recently received attention is the potential to reduce the levels of intra-specific diversity and consequently the global evolutionary and adaptive capacity of species to face novel disturbances. This is particularly important for low dispersal marine species, such as kelps, that generally retain high and unique genetic diversity at rear ranges resulting from long-term persistence, while ranges shifts during climatic glacial/interglacial cycles. Using ecological niche modelling, we (1) infer the major environmental forces shaping the distribution of a cold-temperate kelp, Laminaria hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie, and we (2) predict the effect of past climate changes in shaping regions of long-term persistence (i.e., climatic refugia), where this species might hypothetically harbour higher genetic diversity given the absence of bottlenecks and local extinctions over the long term. We further (3) assessed the consequences of future climate for the fate of L. hyperborea using different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). Results show NW Iberia, SW Ireland and W English Channel, Faroe Islands and S Iceland, as regions where L. hyperborea may have persisted during past climate extremes until present day. All predictions for the future showed expansions to northern territories coupled with the significant loss of suitable habitats at low latitude range margins, where long-term persistence was inferred (e.g., NW Iberia). This pattern was particularly evident in the most agressive scenario of climate change (RCP 8.5), likely driving major biodiversity loss, changes in ecosystem functioning and the impoverishment of the global gene pool of L. hyperborea. Because no genetic baseline is currently available for this species, our results may represent a first step in informing conservation and mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {The kelp Laminaria hyperborea is host for a rich fauna of mobile
invertebrates. Dispersal patterns of these animals may be
crucial for their availability to visual predators like fish,
which are known to search for food in these productive habitats.
Diurnal, horizontal and vertical dispersal within and out of the
kelp forest were studied by analysing colonization of artificial
substrata placed among kelps. The species composition of the
fauna was different on three parts of the kelp: lamina, stipes
(with epiphytes) and holdfast. The artificial substrata were
colonized mainly by species associated with kelp. More species
and individuals colonized the artificial substrata at night than
during the day. The most abundant faunal groups on the kelps and
the artificial substrata were amphipods and gastropods. Both
groups dispersed at a significantly higher rate at night than
during the day. Rapid horizontal dispersal out of the kelp
forest was found. The artificial substrata were also colonized
quickly by kelp fauna at all vertical levels inside and above
the kelp forest. However, species associated with the kelp
holdfast tended to disperse close to the bottom, while
stipe-associated fauna moved through all parts of the kelp
forest and even above the canopy layer. A high dispersal rate
appears common amongst the mobile species living on kelp and
seems to be advantageous, despite the risks involved in
emigrating from the habitat and being exposed to predators.
Higher activity at night may reduce availability to predators.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Macroalgae are important primary producers on temperate
reefs worldwide, yet obtaining accurate measurements of in situ
rates of photosynthesis and respiration for large seaweeds,
particularly kelp, is challenging. Here we describe a novel and
inexpensive photorespirometry system that can be used to generate
photosynthetic-irradiance (P-E) curves for an entire adult kelp
in situ. To demonstrate the application of this system, we (1)
measured and compared P-E curves of the stipitate kelp Ecklonia
radiata at 2 depths in northeastern New Zealand, and (2) compared
laboratory-derived P-E curves to those obtained in situ. The
system enclosed the lamina of the kelp and was sealed around the
stipe, and oxygen evolution was recorded by an enclosed logger.
By varying the irradiance in the chamber with shade cloth, and
utilizing the variation in light associated with depth, the
photosynthetic rates of an individual were measured over a range
of irradiances in situ. Photosynthetic parameters of Ecklonia
from field measurements varied with depth. P-E curves from
individuals measured in situ differed from those measured in the
laboratory, with maximum photosynthetic rates in the laboratory
being 42 and 55{\%} lower under natural and artificial light
respectively. This system provides, for the first time, a method
for generating P-E curves and estimating photosynthetic
parameters for entire adult E. radiata individuals in situ. It
can be adapted for use on other kelp and large seaweeds, and in
tank-based experiments. Importantly, our findings also indicate
that estimates of productivity based on laboratory-derived
photosynthesis measurements likely underestimate kelp forest
productivity.},

The combined effect of the physical variables accounted for 74{\%} of the variation in both monospecific and mixed stands.

under very low light and temperatures. In seaweeds, minimum
light demands for photosynthetic saturation and compensation can
be as low as 10 and 2 $\mu$mol photons m-2 s-1, respectively. For
benthic microalgae, these values can be even lower because of
the limited irradiance reaching deep sea floors. The extreme
shade adaptation of these organisms sets their distributional
limits at depths close to 40 m and enables them to tolerate long
periods of extended darkness. In addition to their capability
for efficient photosynthesis at extremely low light levels,
polar algae possess metabolic adaptations to persist at low
temperatures, which permit them to complete their life cycles at
year-round temperatures close to 0°C. Seaweeds with the lowest
temperature demands are the species endemic to the Antarctic
while Arctic algae are comparatively less cold-adapted. These
adaptive characteristics allow benthic marine algae to make high
contributions to high latitude coastal primary productivity and
energy fluxes, exceeding or equaling the production of primary
producers in more temperate systems. The studies summarized here

abstract = {Large quantities of floating macroalgae are traveling in coastal
waters of the SE Pacific and in other temperate climate zones.
While afloat, these algae are potentially exposed to full solar
radiation, including UVA and UVB, which can have profound
effects on their physiological and growth performance.
Latitudinal variations in UV-radiation (UVR) are hypothesized to
affect floating algae differently with higher impacts at low
latitudes than at high latitudes. In addition, UVR together with
grazing might accelerate the demise of floating kelps. This
hypothesis was tested with outdoor laboratory experiments in
which sporophytes of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.
Agardh were exposed to a combination of different UVR regimes
(PAR only, PAR + UV) and grazing at three sites along the
Chilean coast (20°S, 30°S, and 40°S). A latitudinal trend in
irradiance was detected with increasing values from 40°S to
20°S. Surprisingly, floating M. pyrifera responded with a high
acclimation potential within this latitudinal UVR gradient. At
20°S, floating kelps were slightly sensitive to UVR, which was
reflected in reduced blade growth. At 30°S, physiological
responses were hardly affected by the prevailing irradiance but
sporophyte growth and thus persistence mainly depended on the
presence or absence of amphipod grazers. At high latitudes,
grazing had only minor impacts on algal biomass and blade
growth, and kelps thrived well under all tested environmental
conditions. Overall, our results reveal that floating M.
pyrifera was only slightly affected by UVR and that sporophytes
can efficiently acclimate over a latitudinal UVR gradient that
spans from 20°S to 40°S. Given this high acclimation potential,
we suggest that these (and possibly other) positively buoyant
algae are important dispersal agents over a wide range of
temperate latitude conditions.},

used to detect and describe fine-scale patterns of spatial
structure in assemblages of epibenthic megafauna of the seabed

Presence/absence of benthic organisms was obtained from video
images, which had been collected by means of a remotely operated
vehicle. For sample sizes (grain) of {\textless} 1 m(2), and maximum
between-sample distance (lag) of 200 m, rank-correlograms
revealed the presence of patches in all 12 sites surveyed, and
faunal homogeneity (positive spatial autocorrelation) was always
detected within distances {\textless} 20 m, though there was variation
across sites in the sizes of patches. These findings were further
used to resample the data at coarser grain sizes, to enable
exploring of the faunal composition of the patches. We conclude
that spatial autocorrelation analysis can greatly improve the
design of sampling schemes by ensuring parsimoniousness, and
maximizing the chances of detecting patterns. The procedure shown
here is especially well suited to carry out subsequent mapping

The dependence of the value of p(1) on the numbers of individuals sampled provides a rough way to correct for differences in sample size. This method was applied to data from 16 species, showing that estimated values of Nm range from much greater than I to less than 0.1. These results confirm the qualitative analysis of Slatkin (1981).

diverse assemblage of invertebrates, fish and marine
top-predators such as seabirds and sea mammals. Although kelp is
harvested industrially on a worldwide scale little is known
about the multi-trophic consequences of this habitat removal. We
investigated how kelp fisheries, which remove feeding and
nursery grounds of coastal fish, influence local food webs and
the availability of food to a marine top predator, the great
cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). We conducted experimental
harvesting of the canopy-forming kelp (Laminaria hyperborea)
during a 3year period (2001–2003) in an area at the coast of
Central Norway while synoptically monitoring fish occurrence and
cormorant foraging parameters. Our results demonstrate that
cormorants preferentially foraged within kelp-forested areas and
performed significantly more dives when feeding in harvested
versus un-harvested areas suggesting lower foraging yield in the
former case. In kelp areas that were newly harvested the number
of small ({\textless}15cm) gadid fish was 92{\%} lower than in un-harvested
areas. This effect was persistent for at least 1year following
harvest. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the
ecological consequences of kelp harvesting have been tested at a
multi-trophic level. The results presented strongly suggest that
kelp harvesting affects fish abundance and diminishes coastal
seabird foraging efficiency. Kelp fisheries are currently
managed in order to maximize the net harvest of kelp biomass,
and the underlying effects on the ecosystems are partly ignored.
This study calls for re-assessment of such management practices.},

abstract = {Recent discussions on scaling issues in ecology have emphasized
that processes acting at a wide range of spatial and temporal
scales influence ecosystems and thus there is no appropriate
single scale at which ecological processes should be studied.
This may be particularly true for environmental disturbances
(e.g. El Ni{\~{n}}o) that occur over large geographic areas and
encompass a wide range of scales relevant to ecosystem function.
However, it may be possible to identify the scale(s) at which
ecosystems are most strongly impacted by disturbances, and thus
provide a measure by which their impacts can be most clearly
described, by assessing scale-dependent changes in the patterns
of variability in species abundance and distribution. This, in
turn, may yield significant insight into the relative importance
of the various forcing factors responsible for generating these
impacts. The 1997-98 El Ni{\~{n}}o was one of the strongest El Ni{\~{n}}os
ever recorded. I examined how this event impacted giant kelp
populations in the northeast Pacific Ocean at 90 sites ranging
from central Baja California, Mexico to central California, USA.
These sites spanned the geographic range of giant kelp in the
Northeast Pacific and were surveyed just before, immediately
following, several months after, more than 1 year after, and
nearly 2 years after the El Ni{\~{n}}o. I used a hierarchical sample
design to compare these impacts at five spatial scales spanning
six orders of magnitude, from a few meters to more than 1,000 km.
Variance Components Analyses revealed that the El Ni{\~{n}}o shifted
control over giant kelp abundance from factors acting at the
scale of a few meters (local control) to factors operating over
hundreds to thousands of kilometers (regional control). Moreover,
El Ni{\~{n}}o resulted in the near-complete loss of all giant kelp
throughout one-half of the species' range in the northeast
Pacific Ocean. Giant kelp recovery following El Ni{\~{n}}o was far more
complex and variable at multiple spatial scales, presumably
driven by numerous factors acting at those scales. Recovery
returned local control of giant kelp populations within 6 months
in southern California, and within 2 years in Baja California.},

Zealand, 2017. We integrate biological and physical data to show
that a severe southerly system in July 2017 disrupted this
barrier by promoting movement of substantial numbers of southern
sub-Antarctic Durvillaea kelp rafts across the STF, to make
landfall in mainland NZ. By contrast, a less intense easterly
storm (Cyclone Cook, April 2017) resulted in more moderate
dispersal distances, with minimal dispersal between the
sub-Antarctic and mainland New Zealand. These quantitative
analyses of approximately 200 freshly beach-cast kelp specimens
indicate that storm intensity and wind direction can strongly
influence marine dispersal and landfall outcomes.},

abstract = {The morphology and shape of algae can affect their survival in wave-swept environments because of the hydrodynamic drag created by water flow. Studies of morphology and drag are typically conducted at relatively low water velocities, and the influence of algal morphology on drag, over the range of water velocities algae must cope with in their natural environment, remains unclear. Here, we tested the link between morphological variation and hydrodynamic drag for a dominant kelp with complex morphology (Ecklonia radiata), over a range of water velocities representative of conditions on wave-swept reefs. Our results indicated that kelps on subtidal reefs must withstand maximal orbital water velocities in excess of 2–3 m s-1. Our measurements of drag, resulting from flows ranging from 1 to 3 m s-1, revealed that shape- and width-related thallus and lamina characters were important to drag at low speed, but that total thallus area (or biomass) was the main determinant of drag at high flow. Drag coefficients converged at increasing speed suggesting that, at high flow, significant thallus reconfiguration (more streamlined shape) decoupled drag from morphology. This implies that, at peak velocities, only size (total area), not morphology, is important to drag and the probability of dislodgment.},
annote = {differeneces in blade morphology are thought to be the consequence of a trade-off between limiting drag forces, which prevent breakage and dislodgment for wave exposed morphotypes and maximising light transfer of gas and nutrients for photosynthesis and grwoth for sheltred morphotypes. Therefore, it is generally accepted that algae from sheltered environments have wide, thin and undualte thalli which are often bushy, whereas algae from exposed environments have narrow, thick and flat thalli with thick stipes and more streamlined shape. 

Hydrodynamic forces resulting from wave action is a strong driver in morphological variation either as a consquence of pruning and tattering, which limit size and shape mechanically, or as a consequence of gentotypic pr phenotypic adaption towards characters that minimize hyrdodynamic drag. Hydrodynamic drag is the major driving force of morphological variation in subtidal ecosystems.},

abstract = {A mathematical model to simulate the population dynamics and productivity of macroalgae is described. The model calculates the biomass variation of a population divided into size-classes. Biomass variation in each class is estimated from the mass balance of carbon fixation, carbon release and demographic processes such as mortality and frond breakage. The transitions between the different classes are calculated in biomass and density units as a function of algal growth. Growth is computed from biomass variations using an allometric relationship between weight and length. Gross and net primary productivity is calculated from biomass production and losses over the period of simulation. The model allows the simulation of different harvesting strategies of commercially important species. The cutting size and harvesting period may be changed in order to optimise the calculated yields. The model was used with the agarophyte Gelidium sesquipedale (Clem.) Born. et Thur. This species was chosen because of its economic importance as a the main raw material for the agar industry. Net primary productivity calculated with it and from biomass variations over a yearly period, gave similar results. The results obtained suggest that biomass dynamics and productivity are more sensitive to the light extinction coefficient than to the initial biomass conditions for the model. Model results also suggest that biomass losses due to respiration and exudation are comparable to those resulting from mortality and frond breakage. During winter, a significant part of the simulated population has a negative net productivity. The importance of considering different parameters in the productivity light relationships in order to account for their seasonal variability is demonstrated with the model results. The model was implemented following an object oriented programming approach. The programming methodology allows a fast adaptation of the model to other species without major software development.},

This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications.

Concurrent ecological surveys have demonstrated the dependence of juvenile abalone on urchins for their survival, and a radical increase in the abundance of lobsters in the area that is the main abalone fishing ground. This paper describes laboratory experiments on the consumption of urchins by lobsters, and the preferences for different prey species. Small lobsters ({\textless}68 mm carapace length) ate no urchins. Larger lobsters ate urchins of all sizes, although small urchins were preferred. The consumption rate was easily sufficient for the lobsters to have caused the documented disappearance of urchins ( and juvenile abalone) in the main abalone fishing area. Lobsters showed a strong preference for mussels over all other prey offered, and for juvenile abalone over urchins, although previous field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that urchins provide shelter for juvenile abalone. However, if black mussels were available in addition to sea urchins and juvenile abalone, consumption of sea urchins and juvenile abalone declined.},

There were no consistent differences in storm intensity between years; densities of herbivores within the kelp bed were low and also have not changed between years. The coverage of M. membranacea on laminarian kelps increased 3-fold from 1989 to 1990, and the total coverage of other epiphytes decreased. It appears that the presence of M. membranacea on kelps has contributed to the defoliation of the kelp bed at Cape Neddick.

abstract = {Over the past two decades, several species have undergone
distributional shifts in the southern Benguela. The
commercially-important West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii is
one of these, and its shift in distribution has had profound
effects on the rest of the ecosystem along the south-west coast.
Reasons for these shifts are not fully understood, but are
probably linked to changes in environmental conditions. We
applied a sequential t-test algorithm for analyzing regime
shifts (STARS) to physical (wind and upwelling) and biological
(rock-lobster catch and growth, Bank Cormorant abundance) data
for the southern Benguela inshore region and performed
sensitivity tests on each of the variables. Regime shifts were
defined as `robust' or `possible' if they were detected for⩾70{\%}
or⩾60{\%} of the sensitivity tests respectively. To corroborate
the shifts detected by STARS, we then applied two additional
methods: change point analysis and the Chow breakpoint test. The
STARS method outperformed the other two methods because it could
handle shorter time series and detect shifts towards the end of
the time series, but most of the significant shifts detected by
STARS were also detected by one or both of the other methods. A
significant shift in Cape Point winter winds occurred in 1983,
an El Ni{\~{n}}o year. However, measurement methodology changed during
the same period and this is discussed in relation to the shift.
A decline in rock-lobster growth rate occurred in the mid 1980s,
and significant increases in upwelling variability and mean
summer winds were detected in the early-to-mid 1990s – the same
period in which rock lobster abundance underwent an eastward
shift, declining on the west coast and increasing on the
south-west coast. Bank Cormorants underwent respective declines
and increases in the mid-to-late 1990s on the west and
south-west coasts following the shift in lobsters. Further
shifts in mean wind and upwelling were detected in the 2000s.
These results are a step towards developing ecosystem indicators
for the region, which can be monitored with the intended use of
providing an early warning system for long-term, ecosystem-scale
changes.},

abstract = {Rafting on biotic and abiotic substrata has been reported for
many benthic marine invertebrates. Here, I describe important
characteristics of common floating substrata and review
published studies examining the succession of the assemblage on
detached macroalgae to identify the most important factors
determining this succession. Floating substrata differ in
survival time (i.e. before they disintegrate) and in food value,
with abiotic materials having high survival times but low food
value and some biotic substrata (seagrasses, fresh wood) having
high food values but short survival times. Large macroalgae with
pneumatocysts may combine high survival times and high food
values. Substratum survival and food value have consequences for
the species composition of the rafting macrofauna. In general,
suspension feeders dominate rafting assemblages on abiotic
substrata, while grazing and boring species abound on macroalgae
and wood. The succession of the rafting assemblage can be
subdivided into three phases during which different processes
predominate. During the initial phase some of the original
colonizers (if present) disappear from the substratum, either
due to active emigration or predation. This short, initial phase
is followed immediately by the colonization phase, during which
new organisms colonize the rafting substratum. Colonization may
be rapid and intense in the beginning but then slows down.
Towards the end of the colonization phase, some rafting
organisms may reproduce and their offspring recruit within the
parental raft. Results from two long-term studies confirmed that
the proportion of species with direct development increased with
duration of rafting. These successional changes will be most
pronounced for large biotic substrata, rendering these
particularly suitable for long-distance dispersal of organisms
with direct development.},

We compared the functioning of the community with the intertidal seagrass . Nanozostera noltii as the only macrophyte, in a mixed status with the invasive drift seaweed . Gracilaria vermiculophylla and with only . G. vermiculophylla as macrophyte. These assemblages represent different phases of seaweed invasion.

Across all assemblages production rates were much higher during submerged than during emerged conditions. Assemblage productivity increased from monospecific . N. noltii, through mixed to monospecific assemblages of . G. vermiculophylla. However, the photosynthetic efficiency at low light intensities ($\alpha$) of . N. noltii assemblages was higher than those dominated by . G. vermiculophylla. Metabolic performance patterns were mainly caused by increasing macrophyte biomass from . N. noltii to .

abstract = {Ecological patterns are determined by the interplay between
abiotic factors and interactions among species. As the Earth's
climate warms, interactions such as competition, predation, and
mutualism are changing due to shifts in per capita interaction
strength and the relative abundance of interacting species.
Changes in interspecific relationships, in turn, can drive
important local-scale changes in community dynamics,
biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning, and can potentially
alter large-scale patterns of distribution and abundance. In many
cases, the importance of indirect effects of warming, mediated by
changing species interactions, will be greater-albeit less well
understood-than direct effects in determining the community- and
ecosystem-level outcomes of global climate change. Despite
considerable community-specific idiosyncrasy, ecological theory
and a growing body of data suggest that certain general trends
are emerging at local scales: positive interactions tend to
become more prevalent with warming, and top trophic levels are
disproportionately vulnerable. In addition, important ecological
changes result when the geographic overlap between species
changes, and when the seasonal timing of life history events of
interacting species falls into or out of synchrony. We assess the
degree to which such changes are predictable, and urge
advancement on several high priority questions surrounding the
relationships between temperature and community ecology. An
improved understanding of how assemblages of multiple,

abstract = {Propagule dispersal in seaweeds is a process influenced by a variety of biological and physical factors, the complexity of which has hindered efforts to understand colonization, persistence, post-disturbance recovery, and dynamics of algal populations in general. In view of this limitation, we employ here modifications to an existing turbulent- transport model to explore the mechanics of nearshore macroalgal spore dispersal and its relationship to coastal hydrodynamic conditions. Our modeling efforts focus on four ex- ample species of seaweed whose reproductive propagules span a wide range in sinking speed and height of release above the sea floor: the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, the erect fucoid Sargassum muticum, the small filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, and the flaccid red alga Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii. Results indicate that both propagule sinking speed and release height can affect dispersal distance substantially, but that the influence of these biological parameters is modulated strongly by the intensity of turbulence as dictated by waves and currents. In rapid flows with larger waves, it is primarily fluid dynamic processes, in particular current velocities, that determine dispersal distance. Ad- ditional simulations suggest that patterns of spore dispersal are highly skewed, with most propagules encountering the sea floor within a few meters to hundreds of meters of their parents, but with a sizeable fraction of spores also dispersing as far as kilometers. Such model predictions imply a much greater potential for longer range dispersal than has typ- ically been assumed, a finding with important implications for understanding the demo- graphics of algal populations and for predicting levels of connectivity among them.

Silanes may be used as functional analogs to carbon molecules in environments very different from Earth; solvents other than water may be compatible for life-supporting processes, especially in cold environments, and a variety of energy sources may be utilized, some of which have no Terran analog. We provide a detailed discussion of two possible habitats for alien life which are generally not considered as such: the lower cloud level of the Venusian atmosphere and Titan's surface environment.},

abstract = {UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or "drones") for routine survey applications at the coast have come of age, and are no longer 'the latest thing' more suited to the specialist researcher or amateur enthusiast. Off-the-shelf, survey-grade UAV equipment, data processing and analysis tools are now readily available to practicing coastal engineers, managers and researchers. Within the regulatory constraints that determine their use in many countries, UAVs provide an efficient and cost-effective survey tool for topographic mapping and measurement in the coastal zone. At the practical level, the specialist training required to operate off-the-shelf UAV suited to coastal surveying is now comparable in time and degree of difficulty to learning how to use the equivalent survey capabilities of professional hand-held RTK-GPS equipment. While incremental improvements to both the flight technology and data processing will no doubt continue to occur, from the coastal practitioner's perspective, no more step changes in UAV technology or ease of useability are required. In particular, survey-grade UAVs that incorporate internal RTK-GPS for high accuracy positioning and requiring a single operator only to safely deploy in the field, remove the need for separate and time-consuming on-ground surveying of ground control points (GCPs), previously required during post-deployment data processing. A coastal engineering application of UAV is used here to exemplify the practical use and potential benefits of this now mature survey technology. Over the past 2 years, rapid post-storm deployment of UAV surveying has been successfully integrated into an established coastal monitoring program spanning 4 decades at Narrabeen Beach, Australia. This has extended the scope of this program to include detailed measurements of dune and beachface erosion spanning the full 3.5 km long embayment at a spatial scale and temporal resolution that were previously unfeasible. For both the researcher and practicing coastal engineer, UAVs now provide a practical option for routine coastal surveying.},

associated biota are likely to be determined by the natural
variability of the cold-water coral reef environment. The
sensitivity of reef biota to sedimentation and resuspension
events is largely unknown and the influence of seasonal
phytodetrital deposition is poorly understood. Here we describe
the use of a benthic photolander to monitor this variability by
the Sula Ridge reef complex on the mid-Norwegian continental
shelf and from the Galway carbonate mound in the Porcupine
Seabight. The photolander provides a platform for time-lapse
digital and film cameras to image the seabed while recording the
current regime and optical characteristics (light transmission,
backscatter and fluorescence) of the seawater. In its first two
deployments carried out in 2001 and 2002 by the Sula Ridge the
lander recorded a dynamic environment around the reef site with a
tidal current regime and periods of sediment resuspension.
Current speeds by the Sula Ridge reef complex reached a maximum
of 28 cm s(-1) and 70 cm s(-1) on the Galway carbonate mound,
reinforcing much speculation about the dependence of these
communities on current-swept conditions. Seabed photographs show
intense feeding activity of echiuran worms (Bonellia viridis)
near the Sula Ridge reef complex pointing to rapid bioturbation
of the sediment. Fish were recorded sheltering near sponges that
had colonised glacial dropstones. Longer term monitoring in situ
is needed for study of seasonal change, to identify functional
roles of associated fauna and to monitor potential coral spawning
events. Benthic landers and seafloor observatories have great
potential in these areas. Only with a better understanding of the
natural variability of the cold-water coral environment can
informed decisions about the environmental sensitivity of
cold-water coral reefs and their management be made.},

endemic to the Prince Edward Islands. Aerial photographs of
Marion Island were used to outline the distribution of the kelp
and to assess its cover. M. laevis occurs along the lee shore of
the island, between the 5 and 20 m isobaths. Plant densities and
gross plant morphology were measured by divers during April/May
1988. Net production was estimated from growth measurements
taken in April/May 1988 and 1989 and again during August 1989.
The mean biomass of kelp was 0.67 kgC{\textperiodcentered}m−2 within the kelp beds.
Net production was estimated at 7.7 gC{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}d−1 and 11.5
gC{\textperiodcentered}m−2d−1 during the months of April and August respectively. M.
laevis had a uniform frond-length frequency distribution, which
suggests that only the oldest fronds are lost by wave action or
senescence. Based on calculations for M. laevis and Durvillaea
antarctica (the two species making up most of the macrophyte
biomass) macrophytes are more productive per unit area than the
phytoplankton but contribute less to the seas around the Prince
Edward Islands by virtue of their small spatial coverage.
Neither of the kelps lose much material as particulate or
dissolved organic carbon through fragmentation. The extent of
grazing on live M. laevis fronds is unknown, and only D.
antarctica contributes to a macrofaunal detrital community. The
contribution of M. laevis production to the nearshore ecology of
the islands seems limited, as we suspect that almost all of its
production is exported to the open ocean pelagic system.},

Based on the study of daily input loads to beaches, we estimated summer wrack deposition of up to 140 Mg (dry mass)/km shoreline in Barkley Sound, British Columbia. However, input rates were highly variable depending on beach type, nearshore hydrodynamics, and buoyancy characteristics of the wrack. Cobble beaches retained ϳ10 times and 30 times more wrack than did gravel and sand beaches, respectively. Cobble and gravel beaches also differed in species composition of new (fresh) wrack input, with Ma-crocystis integrifolia being characteristic for the former and Nereocystis luetkeana for the latter, which we attribute to buoyancy characteristics of the floating debris. On sand beaches, Phyllospadix spp. and Enteromorpha spp. were the dominant wrack species. Species com-position of freshly deposited wrack also depended on wave exposure, but predictability based on the species pool within a beach's catchment was restricted. Drift lines of aging wrack differed from freshly deposited wrack in species composition, probably due to wrack decomposition that results in fluxes of nutrients and energy between the adjacent marine and terrestrial habitats. We hold that the characteristics of a given beach, e.g., substratum and wave exposure, and their effects on wrack input, will have important ecological and biogeochemical implications for the marine–terrestrial ecotone.},

abstract = {Data from four studies of waves generated by hurricanes are
reviewed and compared. The combined dataset presents a
consistent picture of the wave field within a hurricane. The
wave field is more asymmetric than the corresponding wind field,
mainly due to the ``extended fetch'' which exists to the right
of a translating hurricane. This concept leads to the
specification of an equivalent fetch for a hurricane which
enables the use of fetch limited growth relations for the
prediction of the significant wave height within a hurricane.
Examination of spectra recorded within hurricanes indicates that
they are remarkably similar to fetch limited forms.
Relationships for the parameters defining fetch limited spectra
are found to also be valid for hurricane conditions. The reason
for the similarity of hurricane and fetch limited spectra is
attributed to the shape stabilizing effect of non-linear
wave–wave interactions, which continually reshape the spectrum
to conform to the standard JONSWAP-like form. Although the wind
speeds within hurricanes are very high, the spectra generated
are mature, with values of non-dimensional peak frequency
typical of fully-developed seas. The analysis develops a set of
standard relationships which can be used to define the wave
field and spectral form for use in design of offshore fixed and
floating structures.},

abstract = {Certain aspects of the foraging behavior of the Cape Rock Lobster, Jasus lalandii, were investigated to determine whether this animal selects prey or merely feeds randomly on a variety of prey items in proportion to their abundance. We also investigated the lobsters' ability to digest unusual food items, e.g., sponges and seaweeds, which are sometimes found in large quantities in their gut. The study combined field observations with analyses of gut contents and digestive enzyme activity. The results suggest that Jasus lalandii is primarily a carnivore with limited ability to digest plant tissue. Preferred foods are black and ribbed mussels (Charamytilus meridianalis and Aulacamya ater correspondingly), and a large variety of marine arthropods; activities of protease and chitinase are strong. Seaweeds are probably only incidentally caught by lobsters. They are only sporadically found in lobster guts. More- over, neither laminarinase nor alginase activity, which is essential for the digestion of plant tissue, was detected. It is possible, however, that Jasus lalandii extracts some starches from marine plants as amylase activity in their gut is strong. The most significant finding of this study is the ability of lobsters to feed on and digest sponges. This is evidenced by large quantities of sponge in certain lobster guts and strong activity of the protease gelatinase (which breaks down the sponge collagen skeleton).},

local sea surface temperatures, and regional precipitation. The
local temperature and precipitation data show that El Ni{\~{n}}o

related to extended periods of above normal sea surface
temperatures and increased precipitation generally associated

abstract = {Over 300 independent river outlets exist around the microtidal,
wave-dominated South African coast. Most of these are located in
drowned river valley settings and have acquired their present
morphology during the Holocene marine transgression. A variety
of geomorphological forms are identified in these estuaries that
result from variation in antecedent topography, fluvial sediment
supply and marine sediment supply. Five distinctive estuary
types are identified on the basis of contemporary
morphodynamics. These are categorised into three types of
normally open estuary (that maintain a semi-permanent connection
with the open sea) and two types of normally closed estuary,
which are separated from the sea for long periods by a
continuous supratidal barrier. The contemporary morphodynamics
and sedimentary environments of each estuary type are discussed.
Open estuaries include barrier–inlet systems maintained by
fluvial discharge (termed river-dominated estuaries) and tidal
discharge (termed tide-dominated estuaries). A third category of
open estuary lacks a supratidal barrier due to inadequate marine
sediment availability. Closed estuaries receive marine influence
via barrier overwash and occasional breaching but are typically
enclosed behind a continuous supratidal barrier. Two categories
of closed estuary are identified: perched and non-perched.
Perched estuaries develop behind high berms and maintain a water
level above high tide level in the open sea. They are often
dominated by fresh to brackish water and breach and drain
periodically. Non-perched estuaries are developed behind
low-elevation barriers fronted by wide dissipative beach
profiles. High overwash frequency introduces marine water into
such systems. Breaching of such estuaries does not produce
dramatic draining as the water level may only drop according to
the stage of the open sea tidal cycle. The variety of estuary
types suggests several potential pathways may exist in estuarine
development and that the progressive infilling model is an over
simplification.},

abstract = {A wide diversity of floating seaweeds is found in temperate and
subpolar regions of the world's oceans where sea surface
currents and winds determine their traveling velocities and
directions. The importance of floating seaweeds as dispersal
agents for associated organisms and for the algae themselves
varies depending on the supply from benthic source populations
and on their persistence at the sea surface. Persistence of
floating algae depends on water temperature, grazing activity,
epifaunal load, and, to a lesser extent, on prevailing
irradiance conditions. In temperate regions, persistence of
floating algae is primarily limited by warm sea surface
temperatures and high densities of motile and sessile epifauna
whereas at higher latitudes algae can successfully compensate
grazer-induced tissue loss by continuous growth at the
prevailing low water temperatures. Accordingly, floating
seaweeds can bridge large oceanic distances especially at high
latitudes allowing for connectivity among distant benthic
populations of algae and associated rafters.},

algi- nates. However, in spite of its ecological and economic
importance, our knowledge of the level and organisation of
genetic diversity in this species is scant. Here, using
comprehensive hierarchical sampling and 7 microsatellite loci, we
explored the roles of dispersal strategies, current regimes and
habitat discontinuities in shaping genetic structure of L.
digitata populations. Our results show that continuous,
non-fragmented forests of L. digitata were genetically
differentiated at distances greater than 10 km, despite the
absence of clear population boundaries. Furthermore, a pattern of
isolation- by-distance indicated that gene flow occurred
preferentially among adjacent populations following a
stepping-stone model. In addition, we analysed the direction of
migration using assignment tests and found that currents appeared
to play a minor role in orienting gene flow, except in the Gulf
of Saint Malo gyre. In contrast, habitat discontinuities were
found to accentuate genetic differentiation and resulted in
reduced genetic variation of isolated stands. In the context of a
potential over-exploitation of kelp stands in Brittany, this
study suggests that the existence of neighbouring populations can
be vital to maintaining high levels of gene flow and thus,
genetic diversity in this species.},

discern responses overlooked by previous methods, which compared
groups of individuals between ``exposed'' and ``protected''

with drag, suggesting that individual blades or populations can
adjust either or both of these parameters in response to their
mechanical environment. The combined effect of this variation is
a stipe breaking force that is positively correlated with
locally imposed drag. Owing to this response to drag, the
estimated wave-imposed limit to thallus size in M. papillatus is
larger than previously predicted and larger than sizes observed
in the field, indicating that factors other than wave force

abstract = {A three-dimensional physical–biological coupled aquaculture
model is developed to study the aquaculture carrying capacity of
kelp in Sungo Bay, a typical aquaculture site in China with
intensive suspended raft aquaculture. In the aquaculture model,
the hydrodynamic module builds on the Princeton Ocean Model by
adding two types of drags due to the aquaculture facilities at
surface and kelp in water column. The biological module
simulates the renewal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), the
cycle of phytoplankton biomass, and the growth of kelp, while
the contribution of bivalves' excretion to DIN is set to a
constant derived from observations. Thus, the coupling between
the growth of kelp and the current variation can be studied by
adding drags in the layers reached by kelp. The simulated
magnitude and vertical profile of currents agree well with
observations. The suspended aquaculture causes a reduction in
the average speed of surface current by 40{\%}, decreasing the
water exchange with the open sea. The simulation results also
show that the seasonal and spatial variations of the DIN
concentration and phytoplankton biomass are clearly controlled
by the distributions of different species. The estimation of DIN
budgets of different periods shows competition between kelp and
phytoplankton. The primary source of nutrients for the growth of
kelp in Sungo Bay is the DIN from the open sea, and the
aquaculture obstruction is the main reason for the deficient DIN
in the kelp culture area. The final kelp production decreases
from the mouth to the end of the bay, consistent with the
spatial variation of water exchange rate. Numerical experiments
have been carried out by increasing the aquaculture density of
kelp from 0.8 to 1.5 times of the current value. Obtained
results indicate that the optimal average density is 0.9 times

hydrodynamics suggest that recruitment of Haliotis rubra is
primarily local. In three neighbouring coastal populations of
Haliotis rubra in southeastern Australia where adult numbers
differed significantly, recruitment was found to be correlated
with the abundance of adult H. rubra counted in each population.
Regional larval dispersal was examined using measurements of
horizontal water velocities near the seabed and at the surface
of one reef. The measurements showed that larvae entering the
water column would be dispersed if they left the shelter of
local reef topography. This dispersal was confirmed by numerical
hydrodynamic and dispersal modelling which simulated the
temporal and spatial variation of wind-driven currents near the
reefs. The results from the models also demonstrated that larvae
entering the water column have a low chance of returning to
their parent reef and that recruitment to some reefs from an
upstream population was unlikely during a typical 3–7-day
pelagic period because some populations were found to be
hydrodynamically isolated from their neighbours. This was
confirmed by plankton surveys several days after the estimated
start of spawning which revealed only one larva of H. rubra in
ocean water around the reefs surveyed. The measurements and
simulation models suggested that settlement of H. rubra would be
most successful if the larvae remained on their parent reef. The
results of additional hydrodynamic studies at the surface of one
reef showed that local reef topography attenuated near-bed
currents sufficiently for larvae of H. rubra to stay on the
parent reef, for example, in rock crevices, for the full pelagic

area and biomass of these species, to determine mechanical and
morphological characteristics that could explain the greater
winter dislodgement of C. crispus thalli in mixed stands.
Although stipes of both species broke at the same mean force, C.
crispus stipes were relatively thick, weak and extensible
compared to the relatively thin, strong and stiff stipes of M.
stellatus. Risk of breakage increased with size in both species
because: 1. (1) their stipes weakened with increasing
cross-sectional area; and 2. (2) cross-sectional area of the
stipe failed to increase in linear proportion to frond area. Drag
on C. crispus thalli of {\textgreater} 3 g fresh weight was greater than on M.
stellatus of the same biomass, whereas drag on smaller fronds ( {\textless}
3 g fresh weight) of the two species was similar. Drag on large
C. crispus thalli was greater mainly because they exhibit greater
surface area for a given biomass than do large M. stellatus.
Dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces has more severe ecological
consequences for M. stellatus because regeneration from holdfasts
is slower than in C. crispus. A reduced surface area:biomass
ratio coupled with greater strength may lessen wave-induced
disturbance and be important to maintaining a high abundance of
M. stellatus in the low intertidal zone of wave-swept shores. {\textcopyright}

abstract = {Around 3000 Ha of New Zealand's coastal waters are presently
allocated to mussel farming of the Greenshell mussel Perna
canaliculus mainly in small inshore farms of 30 000 to 80 000
m/sup 2/ each. The farms are constructed from blocks of parallel
moored long-lines, with loops of spat-impregnated line hanging
vertically in the upper 10-15 m of the water column (provided
sufficient water depth). When fully laden, the mussel loops can
present a rough diameter of 0.20 m or more to the flow. Industry
expansion is likely to be in the form of larger offshore farms.
Some of the larger proposed farms will have more than 1000 km of
mussel line. This presents a potentially significant drag to
currents and waves. In this paper, observations are used from
one of the first large offshore farms constructed in New
Zealand, in conjunction with scaling estimates of energy loss,
to investigate the effect of the farm on waves, currents, and
stratification. The farm, consisting of 230 long-lines arranged
into 20 blocks, measured 650 m /spl times/ 2450 m. The hanging
mussel loops at this site reached an average depth of 8 m, and
water depth at midtide varied across the site from 10-12 m.
Transects were taken through the farm using both conductivity,
temperature, depth (CTD), and Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP)
instruments. A second ADP was moored inside the farm providing
velocity time series. The average current was reduced within the
farm by 36{\%}-63{\%}. The moored ADP detected an undercurrent
beneath the farm with velocities nearly twice that within the
farm. Sharp changes in stratification coincide with the start of
fully stocked mussel long-lines. Furthermore, other than at the
very upstream end of the farm, stratification appears to have
prevented significant vertical mixing between the fluid within
the farm and that flowing under the farm. Wave energy was low
during the 7-d deployment, with significant wave heights peaking
at 0.25 m. The attenuation of transitional waves through the
farm is examined by comparing simultaneous pressure sensor
measurements from offshore and inshore of the farm. The
observations show that wave energy attenuation was frequency
dependent. Observed wave energy attenuation across the 650 m
wide farm was approximately 5{\%}, 10{\%}, and 17{\%} at wave
frequencies of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25 Hz, respectively.},

abstract = {Macroalgae are fundamental components of most marine ecosystems,
creating habitat and food sources for a wide range of other
organisms. Macroalgal distributions are strongly linked to water
temperature, and global environmental change is therefore likely
to drive major shifts both in the distributions and compositions
of marine communities. Phylogeographic research on macroalgae
and associated organisms can reveal ecological changes that have
occurred with global warming since the Last Glacial Maximum
(LGM), which can help us to predict what might happen under
future climate change scenarios. Such research shows that many
macroalgae have changed their distributions, broadly shifting
poleward or into deeper waters. Importantly, for organisms to
change their distributions in response to climate change, they
must be able to disperse, sometimes long distances. Some
buoyant, robust macroalgae are extremely good long-distance
travellers, and others have apparently been able to disperse
across oceans indirectly, such as via rafting. However, not all
macroalgal species are capable of long-distance dispersal, and
with global warming, ecosystems thus do not simply slide
poleward in their entireties, but both move and change. Studies
are already showing that contemporary climate change is
affecting the distributions of macroalgal-dominated ecosystems.
This chapter summarizes some of the ways in which Southern
Hemisphere macroalgal distributions are inferred to have shifted
with past climate change, and speculates on how they might
change in the future. Processes underpinning these changes, such
as climate drivers and dispersal capacity, are also discussed.},

abstract = {The recreational fishery for West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii in South Africa was studied using a multistage telephone interview of permit holders over the 1991/92 to 1994/95 fishing seasons. Recreational catch information, based on permit sales only, are presented for the 1995/96 fishing season. Permit sales increased by 30{\%} from 1991/92 to 1995/96, with a marked increase in 1992/93. The majority of the recreational permit holders were males (80{\%}) between the ages of 25 and 49 years (68{\%}), who were resident in areas close to the resource. Most of the permit holders (74{\%}) fished throughout the season (as opposed to holidays only), mainly (70{\%}) over weekends. Diving and the use of hoopnets from powered boats were the most popular methods of capture, with shore-based methods and the use of hoopnets from rowing boats of lesser importance. The bulk of the recreational catch was landed within the first three months of the start of the season (by the end of January), which was consistent with the trend in permit sales. The total recreational catch of rock lobster increased from 159 tons in 1991/92 to 469 tons in 1992/93, probably because of an increase in the length of the season and a decrease in the minimum legal size limit, and was estimated at 379 tons for the 1995/96 season. The total recreational catch, as a percentage of the commercial Total Allowable Catch, increased from 7{\%} in 1991/92 to 21{\%} in the 1992/93 season and was estimated at 25{\%} in 1995/96$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Bioeconomics emphasizes the common ontological ground between economics and biology. However, this does not necessarily mean that both disciplines collapse into one. Instead it is proposed here that Darwinism provides a general, metatheoretical framework for dealing with complex evolving systems, consisting of populations of varied and replicating entities, which are found in both nature and human society. There is no alternative to the core Darwinian principles of variation, selection and inheritance to explain the evolution of such systems. Neither the actual existence of human intentionality, nor the hypothetical existence of Lamarckian processes of acquired character inheritance, offer a barrier to the use of Darwinian explanations. However, while Darwinian principles are always necessary to explain complex evolving population systems, they are never sufficient on their own. Such a generalized Darwinism can accommodate several different stances found in the literature on bioeconomics and elsewhere.},

Biofilmed abiotic surfaces such as rocks, sand and shells did not induce settlement. Ulvella lens was also included as a control. Treatment of U. australis, A. anceps and C. officinalis with antibiotics to reduce bacterial films on the surface did not reduce the settlement response of H. rubra larvae. Similarly, treatment of these species and encrusting coralline algae with germanium dioxide to reduce diatom growth did not significantly reduce larval settlement. These results suggest that macroalgae, particularly green algal species, may play an important role in the recruitment of H. rubra larvae in the field and can be used to induce larval settlement in hatchery culture.},

Our field collections along an offshore-inshore transect revealed a gradient of larval stages with a greater proportion of earlier stage larvae in the vicinity of offshore canyons, and more mature stage III and IV larvae dominating larval distributions closer to coastal habitats. An empirical trajectory model integrating larval behavior and hydrodynamic properties was then constructed to evaluate potential dispersal mechanisms. Model simulations suggested that passive drift via surface currents and wind-induced transport were insufficient conditions for offshore recruitment subsidies to coastal populations. In contrast, directional swimming of the fourth stage larvae resulted in successful dispersal to the coast within the duration of the plankton phase of H. americanus.},

abstract = {One of the objectives of monitoring benthic algal cover is to
observe short- and long-term changes in species distribution and
structure of coastal benthic habitats as indicators of
ecological state. Mapping benthic algal cover with conventional
methods (diving) provides great accuracy and high resolution,
yet is very expensive and is limited by the time and manpower
necessary. We measured reflectance spectra of three indicator
species for the Baltic Sea: Cladophora glomerata (green
macroalgae), Furcellaria lumbricalis (red macroalgae), and Fucus
vesiculosus (brown macroalgae) and used a bio-optical model in
an attempt to estimate whether these algae are separable from
each other and sandy bottom or deep water by means of satellite
remote sensing. Our modelling results indicate that to some
extent it is possible to map the studied species with
multispectral satellite sensors in turbid waters. However, the
depths where the macroalgae can be detected are often shallower
than the maximum depths where the studied species usually grow.
In waters deeper than just a few meters, the differences between
the studied bottom types are seen only in band 2 (green) of the
multispectral sensors under investigation. It means that
multispectral sensors are capable of detecting difference in
brightness only in one band which is insufficient for
recognition of different bottom types in waters where no or few
in situ data are available. Configuration of MERIS spectral
bands allows the recognition of red, green and brown macroalgae
based on their spectral signatures provided the algal belts are
wider than MERIS spatial resolution. Commercial stock of F.
lumbricalis in West-Estonian Archipelago covers area where MERIS
300m spatial resolution is adequate. However, strong attenuation
of light in the water column and signal to noise ratio of the
sensor do not allow mapping of Furcellaria down to maximum
depths where it occurs.},

abstract = {In marine ecosystems, rising atmospheric CO2 and climate change
are associated with concurrent shifts in temperature,
circulation, stratification, nutrient input, oxygen content, and
ocean acidification, with potentially wide-ranging biological
effects. Population-level shifts are occurring because of
physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal
patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with
local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes
result in altered community structure and diversity, including
possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly
striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the
sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward
species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal
symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude
upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong
linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology,
and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material
flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the
overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and
societies depend.},

abstract = {Growth rates of intertidal snails vary among populations differentially exposed to wave action: individuals from sheltered habitats typically grow more quickly than do those from more exposed coasts. A series of field and laboratory experiments were conducted to separate the genetic and phenotypic components of this variation in Nucella lapillus (L.) and to investigate the extent to which prey type and foraging time, which also vary across the wave- exposure gradient, affect growth. Juvenile and adult whelks were reciprocally transplanted between an exposed and a protected shore and subsequent growth followed. Independent of origin, whelks grew more on the sheltered shore. By contrast, growth rates for snails from exposed and protected shores were similar when reared under uniform conditions in the laboratory. Together these findings suggest that the variation observed in nature does not represent genetic differentiation, but reflects the influence of proximal factors that depress growth on wave-swept shores. Growth rates of juveniles from exposed and protected shores maintained in the laboratory on a diet of an overabundance of (1) barnacles, (2) mussels, (3) both, and (4) both, but only 67{\%} of the time, indicated that prey type and foraging time affect growth. Whelks grew best on a diet of mussels, either singly or in combination with barnacles, grew less on barnacles alone, and least when foraging time was restricted. Because growth rates on specific prey in the laboratory were opposite the observed trend in nature, variation in prey across the exposure gradient cannot be invoked to account for the difference in growth between N. lapillus from exposed and protected shores. The slower growth rates when foraging time was restricted are consistent with the notion that wave energies on exposed coasts depress growth by limiting foraging time or by reducing foraging efficiency.},

abstract = {Quantifying the spatial and temporal scales over which ecological
processes are coupled to environmental variability is a major
challenge for ecologists. Here, I assimilate patterns of
oceanographic variability with ecological field studies in an
attempt to quantify spatial and temporal scales of coupling.
Using coastal time series of chlorophyll-a concentration from
remote sensing, the first chapter examines the alongshore extent
of coastal regions subject to similar temporal patterns of
oceanographic variability in Western North America (WNA) and
North-Central Chile (Chile). I found striking interhemispherical
differences in the length of coastal sections under similar
oceanographic regimes, with the Chile region showing longshore
coherency over much smaller spatial scales ({\~{}}60 km) than on the
coast of WNA ({\~{}}140 km). Through a spatial analysis of coastal
orientation I suggest that the characteristic length scales may
be traced to the geomorphologic character of the ocean margins.
The second chapter examines spatial patterns of primary
production through long-term means of coastal chlorophyll-a
concentration and kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) cover and explores
their relationship with coastal geomorphology and sea surface
temperature (SST). Spatial analyses showed a striking match in
length scales around 180-250 km. Strong anticorrelations at small
spatial lags and positive correlations at longer distances
suggest little overlap between patches of kelp and coastal
chlorophyll-a. In agreement with findings from the previous
chapter, I found that coastal patches could be traced back to
spatial patterns of coastal geomorphology. Through SST time
series and long-term datasets of larval recruitment in Santa Cruz
Island, California, the third chapter examines temporal patterns
of oceanographic variability as determinants of ecological
patterns. SST time series from sites experiencing low larval
recruitment rates were dominated by strong temporal variability.
These sites also experienced the coldest SST detected during the
study suggesting the presence of recently upwelled waters
containing low number of larvae. Larval supply, along with
patterns of community organization presented an accompanying
manuscript, indicated that very strong upwelling may generate
recruitment limitation of populations of intertidal
invertebrates. xii},

abstract = {Marine algae rely on currents and waves to replenish the nutrients required for photosynthesis. The interaction of algal blades with flow often involves dynamic reorientations of the blade surface (pitching and flapping) that may in turn affect nutrient flux. As a first step toward understanding the consequences of blade motion, we explore the effect of oscillatory pitching on the flux to a flat plate and to two morphologies of the kelp Eisenia arborea. In slow flow (equivalent to a water velocity of 2.7 cm s(-1)), pitching increases the time-averaged flux to both kelp morphologies, but not to the plate. In fast flow (equivalent to 20 cm s(-1) in water), pitching has negligible effect on flux regardless of shape. For many aspects of flux, the flat plate is a reliable model for the flow-protected algal blade, but predictions made from the plate would substantially underestimate the flux to the flow-exposed blade. These measurements highlight the complexities of flow-related nutrient transport and the need to understand better the dynamic interactions among nutrient flux, blade motion, blade morphology, and water flow.},

The onset of winter growth in shallow-water stations (6 and 9 m) correlated well with improved dissolved nitrate conditions in the sea. During the winter, reserves of NO3-were accumulated by the plants and reached maximum values of 150 µmoles per g fresh weight in March. This represents a concentration factor of approximately 28,000 over the ambient levels, or an internal nitrogen reserve of 2.1{\%} of the dry weight of the tissue. Depletion of this nitrogen pool followed the disappearance of the external NO3-with a lag period of up to 2 months. Rapid kelp growth was measured during this period. Reserves of organic nitrogen also reached maximum values in March and declined slowly throughout the summer into autumn. It is suggested that the combined inorganic and organic nitrogen reserves sustain the rapid growth rates into July and at reduced rate through the late summer. Fertilization of an experimental perimental kelp bed with NaNO3 increased the internal plant reserves of NO3-and produced a much improved summer growth rate. The enriched plants developed very small reserves of carbohydrate during the rapid summer growth phase.},

abstract = {Coastal populations are often connected by unidirectional current systems, but the biological effects of such asymmetric oceanographic connectivity remain relatively unstudied. We used mtDNA analysis to determine the phylogeographic origins of beach-cast bull-kelp (Durvillaea antarctica) adults in the Canterbury Bight, a 180 km coastal region devoid of rocky-reef habitat in southern New Zealand. A multi-year, quantitative analysis supports the oceanographically derived hypothesis of asymmetric dispersal mediated by the north-flowing Southland Current. Specifically, 92{\%} of beach-cast specimens examined had originated south of the Bight, many drifting north for hundreds of kilometres, and some traversing at least 500 km of ocean from subantarctic sources. In contrast, only 8{\%} of specimens had dispersed south against the prevailing current, and these counter-current dispersers likely travelled relatively small distances (tens of kilometres). These data show that oceanographic connectivity models can provide robust estimates of passive biological dispersal, even for highly buoyant taxa. The results also indicate that there are no oceanographic barriers to kelp dispersal across the Canterbury Bight, indicating that other ecological factors explain the phylogeographic disjunction across this kelp-free zone. The large number of long-distance dispersal events detected suggests drifting macroalgae have potential to facilitate ongoing connectivity between otherwise isolated benthic populations.},

Settlement of sea urchins on artificial substrates deployed in mid-Norway and North Norway was compared on barren grounds and in kelp forests. Settlement varied in time and space, and was low in mid-Norway—the area where kelp is recovering. Settlement did not differ between kelp forest and barren grounds. Densities of adult and juvenile sea urchins were estimated and gonad index (GI) was measured in order to relate sea urchin settlement to local population structure and the reproductive potential of the sea urchin populations. Sea urchin density was generally lower in mid-Norway than in North Norway, but reproductive potential did not differ significantly between the areas. Increasing water temperature is considered a critical factor for sea urchin larval development and may be partly to blame for the recent sea urchin recruitment failure in mid-Norway.

abstract = {A conceptual paradigm, the "Relative Dominance Model", provides the perspective to assess the interactive external forcing-mechanisms controlling phase shifts among the dominant benthic functional groups on tropical coral reefs [i.e., microalgal turfs and frondose macroalgae (often harmful) versus reef-building corals and calcareous coralline algae (mostly beneficial due to accretion of calcareous reef framework)]. Manipulative experiments, analyses of existing communities and bioassays tested hypotheses that the relative dominances of these functional groups are mediated by two principal controlling factors: nutrients (i.e., bottom-up control) and herbivory (i.e., top-down control). The results show that reduced nutrients alone do not preclude fleshy algal growth when herbivory is low, and high herbivory alone does not prevent fleshy algal growth when nutrients are elevated. However, reduced nutrients in combination with high herbivory virtually eliminate all forms of fleshy micro- and macro-algae. The findings reveal considerable complexity in that increases in bottom-up nutrient controls and their interactions stimulate harmful fleshy algal blooms (that can alter the abundance patterns among functional groups, even under intense herbivory); conversely, elevated nutrients inhibit the growth of ecologically beneficial reef-building corals. The results show even further complexity in that nutrients also act directly as either limiting factors (e.g., physiological stresses) or as stimulatory mechanisms (e.g., growth enhancing factors), as well as functioning indirectly by influencing competitive outcomes. Herbivory directly reduces fleshy-algal biomass, which indirectly (via competitive release) favors the expansion of grazer-resistant reef-building corals and coralline algae. Because of the sensitive nature of direct/indirect and stimulating/limiting interacting factors, coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic reversal effects that decrease top-down controls and, concomitantly, increase bottom-up controls, dramatically altering ecosystem resiliencies.},

abstract = {Author(s): Waters, Jonathan M.; King, Tania M.; Fraser, Ceridwen
I.; Craw, Dave | Abstract: Long-distance dispersal (LDD) is
thought to be a key driver of biogeographic processes, yet few
direct natural observations have been made of this process.
Several studies have characterised diverse benthic epibiotic
communities associated with buoyant macroalgae and have proposed
that kelp rafting may be an important LDD mechanism for such
coastal species. We test for LDD by combining biological,
genetic, and geological data from rafted bull-kelp (Durvillaea
antarctica) specimens collected in southern New Zealand
following a March 2018 storm. Genetic and ecological data
strongly indicate that three of 29 detached kelp specimens
sequenced (and their associated live epifaunal taxa) had rafted
from the sub-Antarctic to mainland New Zealand, traversing both
oceanographic and phylogeographic barriers, over the course of
an approximately 4-week journey. Numerous additional epifaunal
taxa were detected from rafts that had geologically-distant
mainland origins. The successful trans-oceanic rafting
documented for sub-Antarctic brooding sea-star, chiton and
sea-slug taxa presents a mechanism for their broad but
phylogeographically disjunct Southern Hemisphere distributions.
Moreover, the detection of several such LDD events over the last
decade suggests that such journeys are very common over
evolutionary timeframes. Although geological and genetic data
were informative over different scales, we detected no conflict
between the inferences from these distinct data sets, a finding
that reinforces the value of integrative approaches to marine
biogeography.},

by measuring variable chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem
II. Germination success of young microscopic zoospores of A.
esculenta was studied under multifactorial stress. Zoospore
suspensions were exposed to the three different salinities and
irradiation conditions at four temperatures between 2 and 16
degrees C. Overall, A. esculenta exhibited a highly
stage-specific susceptibility towards the experimental
treatments. In both experiments using sporophytes,
photosynthetic activity showed significant temperature effects
and only very few significant radiation and salinity effects.
Microscopic stages of A. esculenta were shown to be more
sensitive than the adult macroscopic stages, since germination
capacity of zoospores was significantly affected by temperature
and salinity changes, and interactions of both. These results
suggest that multiple stress factors interact synergistically.
Temperature seems to be a predominant environmental parameter
for the kelp A. esculenta. Overall, A. esculenta proved to be
relatively tolerant and adaptable to increasing temperature and
UV radiation, as well as to diluted salinities, but only up to a

Surface currents correlated with wind, but not tide, offshore winds causing offshore surface drift and onshore currents below, while onshore winds reversed these flow patterns. Water transport budgets indicate that the volume of water at the study site (3??75??106m3) turned over between three and seven times per day during upwelling.

Three of these (spores or zygotes, young germlings, and germlings) are considered early post- settlement (EPS) stages. Many of the available data on recruitment and mortality were not collected with EPS stages specifically in mind, and considerable extrapolation and inference are required to interpret effects on early phases. Data on EPS stages, and grazing in particular, are based on the disappearance of early stages (laboratory or field experiments, including outplantings), on indirect information on mortality from manipulations of grazers or juvenile stages, and combinations of observation and manipulation. We also provide original data on the effects of water motion and canopy sweeping on zygote mortality. The most notable finding is the variability in, and multiplicity of, factors preventing successful recruitment of early life stages. Six intrinsic and about 17 extrinsic factors and/or processes were reported to affect recruitment and mortalit F. Grazing, canopy, and turf effects appear to be most important, but less well studied factors such as desiccation and water motion may be as important for early stages. Our review indicates that recruitment is highly variable, even episodic, and that mortality at this period is high. Combined, these elements suggest that chance events during EPS stages may play a large role in survival, and perhaps the evolution of benthic algae.},

This study examined the reproductive viability and longevity of floating fragments of the intertidal Australasian fucoid Hormosira banksii (Turner) Decne. Beach wrack surveys and field experiments were conducted to test the model that long-distance dispersal is achieved in H. banksii via floating, fertile fronds. High densities of beach wrack fragments were evident during summer compared to autumn. The majority of beach wrack occurred on sandy beaches rather than rocky shores. Both male and female fragments were present in the beach wrack. Detached fronds were capable of releasing gametes up to 8 weeks after detachment. Beach wrack produced high fertilization rates and recruited successfully onto artificial panels. Results suggest that detached fragments are reproductively viable and that floating, fertile fronds may be an important mechanism for facilitating long-distance dispersal in this species. Nevertheless, the frequency of fronds reaching a suitable habitat and contributing to gene flow between populations, or colonizing new populations, may not be proportional to the total density of beach wrack.},

@article{Rothman2010a,
abstract = {In South Africa two species of kelp, Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, occur in quantities sufficient for commercial use. Currently, the former species is harvested in large quantities (about 5 000 tonnes wet weight per year) as abalone feed. In order to set limits to the amount of kelp that may be harvested, it is necessary to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of kelp biomass. Biomass estimates are traditionally obtained by destructive sampling of kelp sporophytes from quadrats placed on the bottom. Scuba divers harvest the plants and weigh them ashore. This method is slow and labour-intensive, and severely limits the area of kelp bed that can be sampled. This study investigates several alternative methods to determine an easier, quicker method of estimating kelp biomass. First, morphometric data on both species of kelp were collected to investigate if there were easily measurable characters that correlate with the weights of individual sporophytes, which then could be used as proxies for destructive sampling. Second, floating quadrats were used to establish correlations between the density of kelp heads at the water surface during low spring tides and kelp biomass. Good correlations were found between (1) individual sporophyte weight and stipe weight for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.5693) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.6175), and (2) individual sporophyte weight and stipe length for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.5828) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.4817). Such measurements are time consuming and labour intensive, and require scuba and destructive sampling. However, using floating 1 m2 surface quadrats, good correlations were found between the density of kelp heads at the surface and the biomass of kelp (E. maxima, p = 0.0000, r2 = 0. 3469; L. pallida, p = 0.0000, r2 = 0.4785). Surface density measurements are more than eight times quicker than the traditional biomass determination method, are non-destructive, require fewer personnel, can be done by snorkelling and are unaffected by water clarity. Furthermore, harvesting for abalone feed is boat-based and targets only surface-reaching kelp. Sporophytes of E. maxima that reach the surface at low water spring tide comprise on average 62{\%} of the total biomass of kelp in these beds, so scuba should still be used where observations and measurements of subcanopy biota are required.

Following a 14-month deployment, we recorded pronounced variability between panels and sites, but did not detect any effect of wave exposure on the structure of panel assemblages. Subsequent data exploration suggested the importance of the presence of kelp recruits (Ecklonia radiata) in structuring the overall assemblage. Panel assemblages with kelp recruits were significantly different in structure to those without, principally because of greater space coverage of encrusting coralline algae and less coverage of red turfing algae, spirorbids, and bryozoans. Mature E. radiata act as ecosystem engineers in subtidal rocky reefs in southwest Australia. Our results suggested the importance of young, recruiting kelps in determining patterns of early community development on newly available hard substrata.},

predator; a predator with no predator of its own, residing at

the majority of unprovoked shark attacks worldwide. Through
human activity, such as finning (the removal and retention of

rapidly over recent years, earning them a vulnerable
conservation status. Conservation of this animal is therefore
necessary to prevent its otherwise inevitable extinction.

aim to better the understanding of this animal, with the
ultimate goal of conservation. I spent one month with this

abstract = {Floating seaweed is considered to be an important habitat for
juvenile fishes due to the provision of food, shelter, a visual
orientation point and passive transport. The importance of the
presence of the highly dynamical seaweed clumps from the North
Sea to juvenile neustonic fishes was investigated by analysing
both neuston samples (without seaweed) and seaweed samples
concerning fish community structure, and length-frequency
distributions and feeding habits of five associated fish
species. While the neustonic fish community was mainly
seasonally structured, the seaweed-associated fish community was
more complex: the response of the associated fish species to
environmental variables was species specific and probably
influenced by species interactions, resulting in a large
multivariate distance between the samples dominated by Chelon
labrosus and the samples dominated by Cyclopterus lumpus,
Trachurus trachurus and Ciliata mustela. The results of the
stomach analysis confirmed that C. lumpus is a weedpatch
specialist that has a close spatial affinity with the seaweed
and feeds intensively on the seaweed-associated invertebrate
fauna. Similarly, C. mustela juveniles also fed on the seaweed
fauna, but in a more opportunistic way. The shape of the
size-frequency distribution suggested enhanced growth when
associated with floating seaweed. Chelon labrosus and T.
trachurus juveniles were generally large in seaweed samples, but
large individuals were also encountered in the neuston. The
proportion of associated invertebrate fauna in their diet was of
minor importance, compared to the proportions in C. lumpus.
Individuals of Syngnathus rostellatus mainly fed on planktonic
invertebrates but had a discontinuous size-frequency
distribution, suggesting that some of the syngnathids were
carried with the seaweed upon detachment and stayed associated.
Floating seaweeds can therefore be regarded as ephemeral
habitats shared between several fish species (mainly juveniles)
that use them for different reasons and with varying intensity.},

abstract = {Models of southern African palaeoclimate implicate surface
atmospheric circulation anoma lies as forcing large-scale
changes during the Late Quaternary. The available proxy data are
insufficient to test the models since they provide information
about temperature and rainfall rather than surface circulation.
A conceptual model is proposed which links coastal ocean
temperatures with atmospheric circulation and allows a history
of surface circulation to be inferred from sea-temperature data.
A Holocene sea-surface temperature (SST) record was constructed
by measuring the oxygen isotope composition of marine mollusc
shells preserved in an archaeological cave deposit on the coast
of the eastern Agulhas Bank, southern Africa. Radiocarbon-dating
of individual shells allowed definition of the timing and
timespan of events in the record. By serially sampling along the
growth axis of each shell, information was obtained about
intra-annual variability as well as millennial-scale trends.
During the early Holocene, the sea surface on the eastern
Agulhas Bank was colder than it is at present. Maximum summer
and winter temperatures obtained 5800 years ago, exceeding by
more than 2°C those recorded in the region today during non-El
Nino years. On average, temperatures remained high for the
following 1500 years but dropped again during the Late Holocene.
At 650 BP, at the start of the 'Little Ice Age' in southern
Africa, the surface waters on the eastern Agulhas Bank were
colder during both winter and summer.Millennial-scale
variability was attributed to the same processes which force
interannual SST anomalies in the region today, namely surface
winds and the Agulhas Current. Negative temperature anomalies
were probably associated with higher volume transport of the
Agulhas Current, which forces upwelling over the shelf edge, and
with increased prevalence of easterly winds, which drive coastal
upwelling. In contrast, a northward displacement of the westerly
wind belt, weakening of the anticyclonic circulation and thus
suppression of both coastal and shelf-edge upwelling may have
been responsible for positive temperature anomalies recorded
during the mid-Holocene. The conceptual model predicts that
negative SST anomalies are associated with wetter conditions
over the southern African interior, whereas warm-water anomalies
are associated with dry conditions.},

debris from the kelp Laminaria pallida shows a succession from
bacteria, through flagellates, ciliates, amoebae and
choanoflagellates over a period of up to 34 d incubation at 10
``C. The biomass of bacteria reaches only 16.5 mg g-' of added
organic matter compared with 42 mg g-' dry weight of dissolved
organic matter added from kelp mucilage, despite the fact that
the combined biomass of grazing protozoans in both cases was
4.2-4.6 mg g-' of added organic matter. This suggests that the
dissolved components of mucilage, comprising principally the
acyclic polyol D-mannitol and other carbohydrates, are more
readily utilisable as a substrate than the particulate components
of kelp debris. The carbon in particulate debris is converted
into bacterial biomass with an efficiency of approximately 11 {\%}
compared with values of up to 29 {\%} which have been reported for
mucilage incubated wlth seawater during the summer Differences in
conversion efficiency of soluble compounds and particulate debris
from L. pallida are also reflected in the time taken for
utilisation by microheterotrophs under culture conditions. The
time taken for 50 {\%} utilisation of particulate debris at 10 ''C
was 240 h compared with reported values of 144 h for sugars and
alginates and only 48 h for mannitol incubated at 10 'C.

72.20 X 104 kg is supported by particulate production and 29.9 X

have transformed ecological . research by providing both spatial
and temporal per spectives on ecological phenomena that would
otherwise be difficult to study (eg Kerr and Ostrovsky 2003;
Running et al. 2004; Vierling et al. 2008). In particular, a
strong focus has been placed on the use of data obtained from
space borne remote-sensing instruments because these provide
regional-to global-scale observations and repeat time series
sampling of ecological indicators (eg Gould 2000). The main
limitation of most of the research-focused satel lite missions is
the mismatch between the pixel resolution of many regional-extent
sensors (eg Landsat [spatial resolu tion of-30 m] to the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer [spatial resolution of {\~{}}1
km]), the revisit period (eg 18 days for Landsat), and the scale
of many ecological processes. Indeed, data provided by these
platforms are often ``too general to meet regional or local
objectives'' in ecology (Wulder et al. 2004). To address this
limitation, range of new (largely commercially operated)
satellite sen sors have become operational over the past decade,
offer ing data at finer than 10-m spatial resolution with more
responsive capabilities (eg Quickbird, IKONOS, GeoEye 1,
OrbView-3, WorldView-2). Such data are useful for eco logical
studies (Fretwell et al. 2012), but there remain three
operational constraints: (1) a high cost per scene; (2) suit able
repeat times are often only possible if oblique view angles are
used, distorting geometric and radiometric pixel properties; and
(3) cloud contamination, which can obscure features of interest
(Loarie et al. 2007). Imaging sensors on board civilian aircraft
platforms may also be used; these can provide more
scale-appropriate data for fine-scale ecological studies,
including data from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors
(Vierling et al. 2008). In theory, these surveys can be made on
demand, but in practice data acquisition is costly, meaning that
reg ular time-series monitoring is operationally constrained. A
new method for fine-scale remote sensing is now emerging that
could address all of these operational issues and thus
potentially revolutionize spatial ecology and environmental
science. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are lightweight,
low-cost aircraft platforms oper ated from the ground that can
carry imaging or non-imag ing payloads. UAVs offer ecologists a
promising route t responsive, timely, and cost-effective
monitoring of envi ronmental phenomena at spatial and temporal

cally relevant variables. Emerging from a military background,
there are now a growing number of civilia agencies and

abstract = {Two species of kelp are exploited commercially in South Africa. Use of beach-cast Laminaria pallida is limited, although it comprises the bulk of the biomass on the northern West Coast. Ecklonia maxima dominates the southern West Coast and provides most of the material for the South African kelp industry. Harvests of E. maxima fronds for abalone feed have reached 3 000{\^{a}}€“5 000 tonnes fresh weight (t f wt) y-1, whereas beachcast material of both species (about 1 000t dry wt y-1) is collected mainly for alginate extraction. For the first time, a South African kelp inventory has been compiled using all available data for the 900km-long West Coast (Cape Agulhas to the Orange River), although a few gaps remain. Beds of E. maxima and L. pallida reaching the surface at low spring tides were mapped using one or several methods: infrared aerial photography, digital multispectral aerial imagery, Landsat satellite imagery, and physical mapping with a hand-held GPS. The data are on a GIS database. Landsat 5 TM imagery could identify the presence of kelp beds, but only infrared aerial imagery and multispectral imaging at low spring tides accurately quantified surface areas of kelp beds. Biomass of the main kelp (E. maxima) is variable in space (between 3kg f wt m-2 and 24kg f wt m-2) and time (changes of up to 50{\%}), making estimates for management difficult. Using an average biomass value of 12kg m-2, the total biomass of surface-reaching kelp beds on the West Coast is estimated to exceed 593 000t f wt, but extensive subsurface beds remain unquantified. Results are discussed in relation to sustainable limits to harvesting, gaps in knowledge, and the improved management of kelp resources.},

abstract = {Many species of macroalgae have flat, strap-like blades in habitats exposed to rapidly flowing water, but have wide, ruffled "undulate" blades at protected sites. We used the giant bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, to investigate how these ecomorphological differences are produced. The undulate blades of N. luetkeana from sites with low flow remain spread out and flutter erratically in moving water, thereby not only enhancing interception of light, but also increasing drag. In contrast, strap-like blades of kelp from habitats with rapid flow collapse into streamlined bundles and flutter at low amplitude in flowing water, thus reducing both drag and interception of light. Transplant experiments in the field revealed that shape of the blade in N. luetkeana is a plastic trait. Laboratory experiments in which growing blades from different sites were subjected to tensile forces that mimicked the hydrodynamic drag experienced by blades in different flow regimes showed that change in shape is induced by mechanical stress. During growth experiments in the field and laboratory, we mapped the spatial distribution of growth in both undulate and strap-like blades to determine how these different morphologies were produced. The highest growth rates occur near the proximal ends of N. luetkeana blades of both morphologies, but the rates of transverse growth of narrow, strap-like blades are lower than those of wide, undulate blades. If rates of longitudinal growth at the edges of a blade exceed the rate of longitudinal growth along the midline of the blade, ruffles along the edges of the blade are produced by elastic buckling. In contrast, flat blades are produced when rates of longitudinal growth are similar across the width of a blade. Because ruffles are the result of elastic buckling, a compliant undulate N. luetkeana blade can easily be pushed into different configurations (e.g., the wavelengths of the ruffles along the edges of the blade can change, and the whole blade can twist into left- and right-handed helicoidal shapes), which may enhance movements of the blade in flowing water that reduce self-shading and increase mass exchange along blade surfaces.},

abstract = {Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh kelp beds - a characteristic feature of the nearshore environment along the south-west Australian coastline - contribute significantly to the coastal biodiversity in temperate Australia, yet, little is known about the organization of these macroalgal assemblages. By compiling existing and new data sets from habitat surveys, we have characterized and compared the structure of kelp-associated macroalgal assemblages in three regions (Marmion Lagoon, Hamelin Bay and the marine environment neighbouring the Fitzgerald River National Park) across more than 1000 kilometres of the southwest Australian coastline. 152 macroalgal taxa had been recognized within the three regions and this is in the range of species richness reported from other Australian and African kelp beds. The kelp-associated algal assemblages were regionally distinct, 66{\%} of all taxa were only found in one region and only 17 taxa were found in all three regions. Adjacent regions shared an additional 13-15 taxa. The regional shifts in assemblage structure were evident in species composition of both canopy and understorey. The organization of assemblages followed a spatial hierarchy where differences in assemblage structure were larger among regions (hundreds of kilometres apart) than among sites within regions (kilometres apart) and differences among sites within region were larger than differences among quadrats within sites (metres apart). Despite this hierarchy each level of nesting contributed approximately the same to total variation in assemblage structure and these spatial patterns were stronger than temporal differences from seasons to 2-3 years. Our results suggest that local and small-scale processes contribute considerably to heterogeneity in macroalgal assemblages throughout south-western Australia, and, in particular, our results are consistent with E. radiata exerting a strong influence on macroalgal assemblage structure. Further, our study contradicts the existence of a general south-west Australian kelp assemblage, although a few species may form the core of E. radiata associations across regions.},

abstract = {Kelps (benthic algae in the order Laminariales) live in a highly
dynamic fluid environment, and exhibit many adaptations to meet
the challenges imposed by hydrodynamic forces. We examined flow
effects (direct and indirect) on understory kelp population
dynamics, morphology and biomechanics along gradients of current
velocity and wave accelerations in the San Juan Archipelago,
Washington. Costaria costata, Agarum fimbriatum, and Laminaria
complanata all exhibited significantly higher mortalities at
wave-impacted sites, but no gradient was detectable in the
effects of tidal currents on survival, despite the strong tidal
signal in waters of the archipelago. This pattern stands in
contrast to that reported earlier for the surface-canopy bull
kelp Nereocystis luetkeana in these waters; N. luetkeana
mortality was strongly correlated with current, but not wave
energy. The higher wave-driven mortalities of the understory
species occur, even though a suite of morphological and
biomechanical attributes (thallus size and thickness, holdfast
area and biomass, stipe cross-sectional area, holdfast strength,
blade toughness) indicate that kelps at sites characterized by
high flow energy are better adapted to resist the forces imposed
by waves and currents. While the forces imposed by strong
currents have little effect on survival, they do have significant
effects on morphology and biomechanical strength. We propose that
morphological plasticity in A. fimbriatum and C. costata
ameliorates the effects of both currents and waves on their
survival.},

abstract = {Numerous studies suggest that floating macroalgae contribute to
population connectivity of the algae themselves as well as of
associated organisms. In order to evaluate the importance of
floating macroalgae for population connectivity in southern Chile
we analysed their spatial and temporal distributions. We
estimated the abundance of floating kelp in the Interior Sea of
Chilo{\'{e}} and the Los Chonos Archipelago via ship surveys conducted
during austral spring (November) and winter (July) of the years
2002-2005. Highest densities of floating kelp (Macrocystis
pyrifera and Durvillaea antarctica) were found during spring.
Generally, the density of floating kelp was relatively low in
areas with high supply of freshwater, and highest abundances were
found in large channels opening to the open ocean. We suggest
that this pattern is caused by the scarcity of natural kelp beds
combined with rapid degradation of floating kelp in the interior
fjords and by seaward surface outflow. The maximum densities of
floating kelps were found in an area known to be an extensive
convergence zone (i.e. estuarine front), which appears to act as
a retention zone. In accordance with this distribution pattern,
we propose that connectivity between local populations via
floating kelp is higher in the outer channels with oceanic
influence than in the inner fjords with high freshwater influx. {\textcopyright}

since been found that freshwater and marine plants are equally
responsive to nutrient inputs. Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients
to the Earth's surface and atmosphere have increased greatly
during the past two centuries. This nutrient enrichment, or
eutrophication, can lead to highly undesirable changes in
ecosystem structure and function, however. In this paper we
briefly review the process, the impacts, and the potential
management of cultural eutrophication in freshwater, marine, and
terrestrial ecosystems. We present two brief case studies (one
freshwater and one marine) demonstrating that nutrient loading
restriction is the essential cornerstone of aquatic
eutrophication control. In addition, we present results of a
preliminary statistical analysis that is consistent with the
hypothesis that anthropogenic emissions of oxidized nitrogen

abstract = {The flow of detritus between habitats is an important form of connectivity that affects regional productivity and the spatial organization of marine ecosystems. Kelps form highly productive beds or forests that produce detritus through incremental blade erosion, fragmentation of blades, and dislodgement of whole fronds and thalli. Rates of detrital production range from 8 to 2657 g C m−2 yr−1 for blade erosion and fragmentation, and from 22 to 839 g C m−2 yr−1 for loss of fronds and thalli. The estimated global average rate of detrital production by kelps is 706 g C m−2 yr−1, accounting for 82{\%} of annual kelp productivity. Detrital production rates are regulated by current and wave-driven hydrodynamic forces and are highest during severe storms and follow- ing blade weakening through damage by grazers and encrusting epibionts. Detritus settles within kelp beds or forests and is exported to neighboring or distant habitats, including sandy beaches, rocky intertidal shores, rocky and sedimentary subtidal areas, and the deep sea. Exported kelp detritus can provide a significant resource subsidy and enhance secondary production in these communities ranging from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers from the source of production. Loss of kelp biomass is occurring worldwide through the combined effects of climate change, pol- lution, fishing, and harvesting of kelp, which can depress rates of detrital production and subsidy to adjacent communities, with large-scale consequences for productivity.},

abstract = {Understanding connectivity remains a fundamental challenge to marine ecology due to technical limitations of tracking larval dispersal. Marine population genetic analyses are often used to make inferences about the scale of population connectivity. For species with a larval phase, pelagic larval duration (PLD) is assumed to influence the scale of connectivity. If PLD and genetic metrics are reliable proxies of connectivity, the 2 should be well correlated. Previous tests report conflicting results, with many reports that global F-ST (Wright's fixation index) correlates poorly with PLD, and one very high correlation of isolation-by-distance (IBD) slope, which is derived from F-ST, with PLD. First we clarify the expectations for the performance of these different proxies in light of the latest understanding of larval dispersal dynamics. We then test the hypothesis that IBD slope may be a more robust correlate with dispersal scale than global F-ST with a new dataset of recent marine genetic studies. Re-evaluation of previously published and new datasets revealed a consistent, moderate fit (R-2 similar to 0.30) between genetic and PLD proxies of dispersal (using either IBD slope or global F-ST), with significant improvement for small-scale ({\textless}650 km) studies (R-2 = 0.50), and important effects of marker type. Significant effects of number of individuals and number of populations sampled on the genetic metrics in our dataset suggest a common need for more robust sampling designs. These results synchronize previous studies on this topic and provide validation that PLD and genetic metrics typically reflect scales of dispersal, as intended, at least when sampling design is robust.},

abstract = {Gene flow in macroalgal populations can be strongly influenced
by spore or gamete dispersal. This, in turn, is influenced by a
convolution of the effects of current flow and specific plant
reproductive strategies. Although several studies have
demonstrated genetic variability in macroalgal populations over
a wide range of spatial scales, the associated current data have
generally been poorly resolved spatially and temporally. In this
study, we used a combination of population genetic analyses and
high-resolution hydrodynamic modelling to investigate potential
connectivity between populations of the kelp Laminaria digitata
in the Strangford Narrows, a narrow channel characterized by
strong currents linking the large semi-enclosed sea lough,
Strangford Lough, to the Irish Sea. Levels of genetic
structuring based on six microsatellite markers were very low,
indicating high levels of gene flow and a pattern of
isolation-by-distance, where populations are more likely to
exchange migrants with geographically proximal populations, but
with occasional long-distance dispersal. This was confirmed by
the particle tracking model, which showed that, while the
majority of spores settle near the release site, there is
potential for dispersal over several kilometres. This combined
population genetic and modelling approach suggests that the
complex hydrodynamic environment at the entrance to Strangford
Lough can facilitate dispersal on a scale exceeding that
proposed for L. digitata in particular, and the majority of
macroalgae in general. The study demonstrates the potential of
integrated physical-biological approaches for the prediction of
ecological changes resulting from factors such as
anthropogenically induced coastal zone changes.},

and herbivorous snails. The first study (1989), performed in
streamside channels, tested the effects of three factors: (1)
stream water nitrogen (N), (2) phosphorus (P), and (3) snail
grazing, on periphyton biomass, productivity, and community
composition. The second study (1990), conducted in situ, tested
the effects of snail grazing and nutrients (N + P). In the 1989
study, nutrients had positive effects, and herbivores had
negative effects, on algal biomass (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry
mass, total algal biovol? ume) and primary productivity (area-
and chlorophyll-specific). Likewise, both nutrients and snail
grazing exerted effects (+ and -, respectively) on biomass
measured in the 1990 study (chlorophyll a, algal biovolume).
Grazed communities were dominated by chloro- phytes and
cyanophytes, which were overgrown by diatoms when herbivores were
removed. Algal species that were reduced most by herbivores were
increased most by nutrient ad? dition, and vice versa, suggesting
a trade-off between resistance to herbivory and nutrient-
saturated growth rates. Increases in algal biomass and
productivity were slight with the addition of either N or P
compared to responses observed when both nutrients were added
together, suggesting that both nutrients were at growth-limiting
levels. The greatest changes in periphyton structure or function
were observed when both nutrients were added and simultaneously,
grazers were removed, in contrast to lesser effects when
nutrients were added under grazed conditions or grazers were
removed at low nutrient levels, indicating dual control by both
factors. Nutrient addition also positively affected snail growth
in both experiments, indicating tight coupling between herbivore
and algal growth (top-down ef? fects) and that bottom-up factors
that directly affected plant growth could also indirectly affect
consumers belonging to higher trophic levels. Indices quantifying
the direct effects of top-down factors relative to bottom-up
factors (top-down index, TDI) and the importance of interactions
between these factors (interaction coefficient, IC) were
computed. These indices showed that the relative strength of
top-down and bottom-up factors varied among biomass and
productivity parameters and that top-down and bottom-up effects,
alone, were less important than their combined effects. Key},

grown at 15°C contained significantly more chlorophylla (chla)
than did similar plants grown at 5°C. The increase in chla in
15°C plants was due to increased numbers of photosystem II
reaction centes, and possibly to increased photosynthetic unit
size, compared with 5°C plants. These changes were associated
with increased$\alpha$ values (photosynthetic efficiencies) in
15°C-grownL. saccharina relative to 5°C-grown plants. The
changes in$\alpha$ together with reduced respiration rates allowed
15°C-grownL. saccharina to achieve net photosynthesis and
light-saturated photosynthesis at a lower photon fluence rate
(PFR) than 5°C plants when both groups were assayed at the same
temperature (15°C). The photon fluence rates necessary to reach
the compensation point and achieve light-saturated
photosynthesis (I c andI k , respectively) increased with
increasing incubation temperature inL. saccharina grown at both
5 and 15°C. However, acclimation responses to growth temperature
compensated for the short-term effect of temperature onI c andI
k . Consequently, plants grown at 5 and 15°C were able to
achieve similar rates of light-limited photosynthesis, and
similarI c andI k values at their respective growth
temperatures. These responses are undoubtedly important for
perennial seaweeds such asL. saccharina, which frequently grow
in light-limited habitats and experience pronounced seasonal
changes in water temperature.},

Island. Collections of plants from eight sites in the summer of
1999 showed considerable morphological variation. Plants were

analyses showed two groups of populations: one group with
smaller, regularly dichotomous thalli (morphotype A), and the
other group with larger, more irregularly branched thalli
(morphotype B). The smaller thalli had flat-topped utricles with
small mucrons, whereas the larger plants had utricles with more
lanceolate tips and larger mucrons. Cluster analysis and
principle component analysis largely distinguished these forms.
The larger plants are typical of C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides

characteristic of C. fragile ssp. atlanticum (Cotton) Silva.

Harpacticus were successful colonisers, in particular
Harpacticus chelifer and Harpacticus uniremis. In a survey of

Relationships between groups and environmental factors were determined by correspondence analysis, and results were validated by a canonical correspondence analysis of species and environment. To compare the group biodiversities we used species richness and diversity indices and abundance biomass comparisons curves. Analysis with incidence data discriminated one shallow Iridaea assemblage and one deep Himantothallus assemblage. Analysis using biomass discriminated three facies, the first in the upper zone (Iridaea cordata, Monostroma hariotii, Adenocystis utricularis, Enteromorpha bulbosa), the second (Desmarestia menziesii, D. antarctica, Ascoseira mirabilis, Curdiea racovitzae, Gigartina skottsbergii, Kallymenia antarctica, Neuroglossum delesseriae, Phaeurus antarcticus, Gymnogongrus turquetil) at intermediate depth and the third (H. grandifolius, D. anceps, Georgiella confluens, Ballia callitricha, Plocamium cartilagineum), coincident with the deep qualitative assemblage, was found in a less disturbed environment. The difference in species composition between the groups was mainly related to depth as an environmental variable. The high specific diversity at intermediate depths can be explained by the presence of patches in different successional stages caused by iceberg scouring.},

abstract = {Abstract The effect of stochastic variability upon the wake
downstream of a real headland is investigated. From observations
taken at Bass Point, Australia, three sources of stochastic
forcing are identified and quantified, these being variability
in the wind stress, in the flow incident on the headland, and
that generated in the flow by complex reef topography at the
headland's tip. These sources of stochastic forcing are found to
induce a significant degree of unsteadiness in a nonlinear
numerical model of flow around Bass Point that, in the absence
of stochastic forcing, simulates steady recirculating flow. The
observed stochastic variability of the flow incident on the
headland is found to be larger than is necessary to support
unsteadiness in the simulated straining zone. The dynamics of
the perturbation growth observed in the model are understood by
applying the techniques of generalized stability theory to the
associated tangent linear model (TLM). The eigenmodes of the TLM
confirm that the system is asymptotically stable, but analysis
reveals that these eigenmodes are nonorthogonal and hence that
the dynamical system is nonnormal. It is found that the model's
response to stochastic forcing is not controlled by the least
damped eigenmodes of the TLM, but rather by the least damped of
its most nonnormal modes. The pseudospectra of the system
suggest that the nonnormal modes are excited and sustained by
the process of pseudoresonance. The nonnormality of the system
permits transient growth of disturbances, because this allows a
linear sum of exponentially decaying nonorthogonal modes to grow
for a finite period because of eigenmode interference. Only in
the absence of forcing do the least damped modes dictate the
character of the flow. It is concluded that the subcritical
transition to unsteady flow observed in the model may occur in
straining coastal ocean circulations in general because of the
ubiquity of environmental noise. As a result, nondimensional
parameters such as the Reynolds number may only give a
probability of transition occurring in nonnormal geophysical
systems.},

abstract = {Abstract A theory of the depth-averaged currents and sea surface
elevation generated by a moving hurricane in a stratified ocean
with flat bottom is presented. Using a scale analysis of the
depth-integrated momentum and continuity equations, it is found
that the depth-averaged currents are nearly nondivergent and
determined entirely by the wind stress curl. Earth's rotation
and ocean stratification have negligible effects. The sea
surface elevation is decomposed into four physically different
parts caused by geostrophic adjustment to the depth-averaged
currents, wind stress divergence, inverted barometer offset, and
baroclinic effects. When a hurricane moves with a uniform speed,
it generates quasi-stationary, alongtrack, elongated
depth-averaged currents. The sea surface elevation remaining
after the hurricane passage is a combination of a trough
geostrophically adjusted with the depth-averaged currents and a
sea surface elevation associated with baroclinic effects. The
barotropic response is analysed for different wind stress
distribution. A universal nondimensional description of the
depth-averaged flow is suggested, using scaling based on the
maximum wind stress torque LTL and its radius L. This marks the
primary difference with baroclinic responses where the radius of
maximum winds, Rm, and maximum wind stress Tm are the
determining scales. For all cases considered, the maximum
depth-averaged current is proportional to LTL and the distance
from the maximum to the storm track is proportional to L. The
wind stress behavior at the hurricane's periphery is shown to be
an important feature in .determining the sea surface response.
Analytical solutions of approximated equations agree well with
numerical simulations based on the full set of equations. It is
demonstrated, using a two-layer model, that nonlinear coupling
between the baroclinic and barotropic modes is rather weak, and
therefore they may be calculated separately.},

abstract = {At three sites (Papanui Inlet, Aquarium Point and Seacliff) on
the Otago coast of New Zealand and at one site (Point Loma) off
southern California, morphometric and shortterm growth
measurements were made of single fronds of plants of Macrocystis
pyrifera (L.) C. Ag. near the time of the autumn equinox, in
1977. Near the apex, internodes and laminae were shorter in
wave-exposed Seacliff and California populations than in those
of Papanui Inlet and Aquarium Point in strong currents, although
lamina thickness was similar. In the immature region near the
apex, linear relationships were apparent from double logarithmic
plots of stipe distance from apex vs node number, internode
fresh weight vs length (different in the two areas), lamina
width vs length, fresh weight vs lamina area and immature
lamina, pneumatocyst and internode fresh weight vs node number.
Morphologically, Seacliff plants resembled those in California
more closely than those in the other New Zealand populations.
The relative growth rate in length of stipe internodes decreased
linearly with the logarithm of the distance from the apex, but
was less closely related to node number. Extrapolation gave zero
growth at 1.6 m at Aquarium Point and 2.9 m in California, where
the internode lengths coincided with a change in their
weight/length relationship. Slow relative growth proximal to
these points indicated a different type (mainly elongation). It
is suggested that the first, apical, type of growth, being
apparently unrelated to frond length, would be a useful measure
of activity over short time-periods. The relative growth rate in
lamina area (and probably volume), while also related to
distance from the apex, showed a very different pattern,
increasing slightly to a peak at 100 to 200 mm and declining to
nil by 1 m at Aquarium Point and 2 m in California. Maximal
lamina size was maintained for only 10 to 15 nodes at Aquarium
Point. Calculated node initiation frequencies were 2.7 d at
Papanui Inlet, 2 d at Aquarium Point, and 1 d in California. At
the latter sites it took about 2 mo for laminae and 21/2 mo for
stipe internodes to mature. Deduced relative growth rates in
stipe tissue and pneumatocyst fresh weight decreased from 0.24
(loge units per day) at the apex to 0.11 at 200 mm, where basal
lamina tissue had a rate of 0.29, a doubling in just over 2 d.
The production of tissue per frond was estimated as 25 and 36 g
fresh wt d-1 at Aquarium Point and in California, respectively.},

recent Central European summer heat waves (2003 and 2006) on
cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic, shallow lake. While a bloom
of cyanobacteria developed in 2006, consistent with our
expectations, cyanobacterial biomass surprisingly remained at a
record-low during the entire summer of 2003. Critical thresholds
of abiotic drivers extracted from the long-term (1993-2007) data
set of the studied lake using classification tree analysis (CTA)
proved suitable to explain these observations. We found that
cyanobacterial blooms were especially favoured in 2006 because
thermal stratification was critically intense (Schmidt stability
{\textgreater}44 g cm cm(-2)) and long-lasting ({\textgreater}3 weeks). Our results also
suggest that some cyanobacterial species (Anabaena sp.)
benefitted directly from the stable water column, whereas other
species (Planktothrix sp.) took advantage of
stratification-induced internal nutrient loading. In 2003,
conditions were less favourable for cyanobacteria due to a spell
of lower temperatures and stronger winds in mid-summer; as a
result, the identified thresholds of thermal stratification were
hardly ever reached. Overall, our study shows that extracting
critical thresholds of environmental drivers from long-term
records is a promising avenue for predicting ecosystem responses
to future climate warming. Specifically, our results emphasize
that not average temperature increase but changes in short-term
meteorological variability will determine whether cyanobacteria
will bloom more often in a warmer world.},

Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEI) to establish benchmark
data and explore their potential use for monitoring long-term
change. Gaimardia trapesina and its potential food sources were
collected and analysed for size structure, attachment strength,
and diet, using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. The
populations examined were dominated by relatively small
individuals. The strength of attachment to kelp blades was low
and the byssal threads showed high elasticity. The PEI lie in
the path of the west–east flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current
and the highest abundances of G. trapesina were found on the
downstream sides of both islands, while the species was absent
from the western, upstream coasts. Both diet analyses and SIAR
mixing models indicated that G. trapesina feeds on suspended
particulate matter, while kelp particles contribute minimally to
the diet. Considering the wide distribution of G. trapesina, its
importance as food for birds and fish, and its sensitivity to
environmental conditions, there is good potential to use this

Currents can fluctuate rapidly, changing by many 10s of cm s–1

as fronts, eddies, oxygen minimum zones and blooms has been
challenging primarily due to the large spatial scales involved.
Traditional methods of ob- servation with manned ships are
expensive and, unless the vessel can survey at high-speed,
unrealistic. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robotic
platforms that have been making steady gains in sampling
capabilities and impacting oceanographic observations especially
in coastal areas. However, their reach is still limited by
operating constraints related to their energy sources. Unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently introduced in coastal and polar
oceanographic experiments have added to the mix in observation
strategy and methods. They offer a tantalizing opportunity to
bridge such scales in operational oceanog- raphy by coordinating
with AUVs in the water-column to get in-situ measurements. In
this paper, we articulate the principal challenges in operating
UAVs with AUVs making synoptic observations for such targeted
water- column sampling. We do so in the context of autonomous
control and operation for networked robotics and describe novel
experiments while articulating the key challenges and lessons

This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investi- gates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20–30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 × 20 m lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield. This method is likely to minimize damage to the kelp bed system.},

The photogrammetric potential for direct georeferencing of micro-UAVs is quite high, but until now has not been fully exploited.

per-offspring parental investment were estimated from marked
snails during a 3-yr period. Growth rates as indicated by changes
in shell length, total mass, shell mass, and body mass varied
among populations from different exposure regimes. Relative to
more protected sites, snails from exposed shores grew more slowly

mortality rates indicated that the higher mortality on wave-swept
shores reflected decreased survivorship of large ( 15 mm) adults
relative to similar sized individuals on more protected shores.
Exposed shore snails deposited twice as many egg capsules with
twice as many hatchlings emerging from each capsule. Although the
hatchlings were -25{\%} smaller, four times as many were pro-

abstract = {The kelp Laminaria hyperborea forms large forests and houses a
numerous and diverse fauna, especially in the kelp holdfast and
stipe epiphytes. Kelp harvesting creates cleared areas and
fragmentizes the kelp forest. We investigated the dispersal
ability of kelp fauna to cleared, harvested areas by studying
their colonization pattern to artificial substrata (kelp mimics)
exposed for a short (3 days) and longer time period (35 days) at
different sites within the kelp forest (one site) and at a
cleared area (two sites). Most of the kelp fauna (111 species)
showed a rapid dispersal and colonized the artificial substrata
within the cleared area. The similarity of the faunal community
in the mimics with the natural kelp holdfast community increased
with the length of the exposure period. During the experiments,
87{\%} of the mobile species in the kelp plants were found in the
kelp mimics, indicating good dispersal for slow-moving animals
like gastropods, polychaetes and tube-building crustaceans.
Relating the frequency of the different faunal groups in the
untrawled kelp forest to their frequency in the kelp mimics,
showed gastropods, amphipods and decapods to have relatively
high dispersal rates, whereas isopods, bivalves, polychaetes and
tanaids showed a lower dispersal rate than expected. Amphipods
dispersed as juveniles and adults. No significant differences
were found between the faunal composition and number of species
in the mimics placed inside the kelp forest and in the cleared
area. Remaining holdfasts and pebbles were identified as
refuges/alternative habitats in the harvested area, and may
together with the nearest kelp vegetation, serve as sources for
colonization to new substrata. The high dispersal ability of
most of the kelp fauna provides maintenance of the faunal
composition of disturbed habitats and ensures colonization of
recovering algal habitats regardless of reproduction strategy.},

which were probably exchanged after the opening of the Bering
Seaway (3.5 MA ago); their temperature responses indicate that
their passage required a 6–8°C higher summer temperature than
the present one in the Arctic Ocean. Some species in the above
group, for instance Desmarestia viridis, have also an amphipolar
distribution. Their passage across the tropics would have
required a ca 5°C lowering of the equatorial sea surface
temperature. This same temperature lowering can explain the
extinction, along the east coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans, of tropical seaweeds such as Dictyosphaeria cavernosa
with a W Atlantic-Indo W Pacific distribution. This lowering
probably did not occur (sub)recently (for instance during
Pleistocene glaciations), but earlier in the Cenozoic. We
approached the question of the timing of the above temperature
lowerings by estimating genetic divergence of disjunct
populations of the same species or species complexes using the
DNA-DNA hybridization method. Disjunct Atlantic and Pacific
populations of several tropical and warm temperate species
appeared to have genetically diverged in a high degree thus
indicating a highly conservative morphology; this accords with
their hypothetical divergence by the mid-Miocene (or earlier)
closure of the Tethys Ocean. The divergence of amphipolar
populations of the same species was probably more recent.
Temperature changes of the sea surface predicted for the next
century have a similar extent as those which have caused, in a
more or less distant geologic past, profound alterations in the

northern hemisphere. A cladistic phylogeny and distributions of
these taxa form the basis of a discussion of the historical
biogeography of the group. Successively more derived taxa are
present in the tropical Atlantic, western North America,
Southeast Asia, Japan, the northern Pacific and the northern
Atlantic, and similar area relationships are suggested by some
other taxonomic groups. A dispersalist interpretation suggests a
Tethyan origin and westward range expansion, but in the absence
of a complete fossil record this cannot be confirmed. It is
argued that westward trans-Pacific dispersal is unlikely.
Instead, a vicariant model is proposed, involving speciation in
response to climatic cooling during the Cenozoic. This explains
the progression of more derived species at higher latitudes on
the Asian coast, which could be a common pattern in marine
shallow-water organisms on continental margins. The cladogram
suggests that the northern Atlantic species originated from at
least two immigrants from the Pacific. The fossil record
indicates that these reached the Atlantic by an Arctic route
following the opening of the Bering Strait in the Upper
Pliocene. In both oceans, clades with nonplanktotrophic
development have shown the greater rates of speciation. Within
the Atlantic Ocean there is no clear area cladogram; instead

abstract = {Aim Shifts in species ranges are a predicted and realized effect
of global climate change; however, few studies have addressed the
rates and consequence of such shifts, particularly in marine
systems. Given ecological similarities between shifting and
introduced species,we examined howour understanding of range
shiftsmay be informed by the more established study of non-native
species introductions. Location Marine systems world-wide.
Methods Database and citation searches were used to identify 129
marine species experiencing range shifts and to determine spread
rates and impacts on recipient communities. Analyses of spread
rates were based on studies for which post- establishment spread
was reported in linear distance. The sizes of the effects of
community impacts of shifting species were compared with those of
functionally similar introduced species having ecologically
similar impacts. Results Our review and meta-analyses revealed
that: (1) 75{\%} of the range shifts found through the database
search were in the poleward direction, consistent with climate
change scenarios, (2) spread rates of range shifts were lower
than those of introductions, (3) shifting species spread over an
order of magnitude faster in marine than in terrestrial systems,
and (4) directions of community effects were largely negative and
magnitudes were often similar for shifters and introduced
species; however, this comparison was limited by few data for
range-shifting species. Main conclusions Although marine range
shifts are likely to proceed more slowly than marine
introductions, the community-level effects could be as great, and
in the same direction, as those of introduced species. Because it
is well- established that introduced species are a primary threat
to global biodiversity, it follows that, just like introductions,
range shifts have the potential to seriously affect biological
systems. In addition, given that ranges shift faster in marine
than terrestrial environments, marine communities might be
affected faster than terres- trial ones as species shift with
climate change. Regardless of habitat, consideration of range
shifts in the context of invasion biology can improve our
understanding of what to expect from climate change-driven shifts
as well as provide tools for formal assessment of risks to
community structure and function.},

abstract = {The temperature tolerances of individuals in geographically
separated populations of a single species can be used as
indicators of each population's potential to persist or become
extinct in response to climate change. We evaluated the
population-level variation in temperature tolerance in
populations of several marine invertebrate taxa, including
bryozoans, tunicates, bivalves, and gastropods, separated by
distances of 5000. km. We then combined physiological
thermotolerance data with current temperature data and climate
change predictions to predict which of these populations may be
most vulnerable to future changes. In a trans-continental
comparison of four subtidal epibenthic species, we show that
populations on the east coast of the United States, which
experienced higher habitat temperatures than those on the west
coast, had higher thermal tolerances but lived closer to
individuals' tolerance limits. Similarly, temperature tolerances
varied between western and eastern Atlantic populations of the
mussel Mytilus edulis; however, these differences only emerged
after repeated exposures to high temperatures. Furthermore, the
less thermotolerant M. edulis population in the western Atlantic
was more susceptible to temperature increases, as evidenced by a
recent range contraction. Thus, for both the subtidal epibenthic
and intertidal mussel species, we identified the western
Atlantic as a 'hot spot' of populations susceptible to climate
change compared to those in the eastern Pacific and eastern
Atlantic, respectively. Finally, because current tolerances are
not the sole indicators of individuals' abilities to cope with
temperature increases, we also assessed the possibility for
acclimatization to facilitate the persistence of populations via
the buffering of temperature effects. We show that, for four
populations of intertidal Littorina snail species in the
northwest Atlantic, most populations were able to overcome
geographic differences in temperature tolerance via acclimation.
When acclimation capacity is low, the potential for ``rescue''
may depend on the particular species' life-history strategy and
dispersal ability. For example, although individuals from the
coldest-adapted population of Littorina littorea were unable to
acclimate as quickly as those from more southern populations,
this species has a pelagic larval stage and, thus, the greatest
dispersal potential of these littorines. Together, these studies
highlight the importance of considering variation in temperature
tolerance between populations within species to improve the
forecasting of changes in the abundances and distributions of
species in response to climate warming. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate models predict a dramatic increase in the annual frequency and severity of extreme weather events during the next century. Here we show that increases in the annual frequency of severe storms lead to a decrease in the diversity and complexity of food webs of giant kelp forests, one of the most productive habitats on Earth. We demonstrate this by linking natural variation in storms with measured changes in kelp forest food web structure in the Santa Barbara Channel using structural equation modeling (SEM). We then match predictions from statistical models to results from a multiyear kelp removal experiment designed to simulate frequent large storms. Both SEM models and experiments agree: if large storms remain at their current annual frequency (roughly one major kelp-removing storm every 3.5 years), periodic storms help maintain the complexity of kelp forest food webs. However, if large storms increase in annual frequency and begin to occur year after year, kelp forest food webs become less diverse and complex as species go locally extinct. The loss of complexity occurs primarily due to decreases in the diversity and complexity of higher trophic levels. Our findings demonstrate that shifts in climate-driven disturbances that affect foundation species are likely to have impacts that cascade through entire ecosystems.},

Multispecies analyses using phylogeographic and ecological data indicate that 10 epifaunal invertebrate species rafted on six large bull kelp specimens for several weeks from the subantarctic Auckland and/or Snares Islands to the Otago coast of New Zealand, a minimum distance of some 400-600 km. These genetic data are the first to demonstrate that passive rafting can enable simultaneous trans-oceanic transport and landfall of numerous coastal taxa.},

Curac¸ao (Netherlands Antilles) where it inhabits strongly
contrasting habitats. Changes in population structure have been
followed in three bays with increasing levels of wave exposure at
two depths: shallow (0 m) and deep (18 m). The effects of
increasing wave exposure were investigated by studying three
deepwater populations; and the effects of depth by studying
shallow- and deep-water populations in the two calmer bays. Total
density and stage density (reproductive thalli, juvenile thalli)
were determined and total and individual thallus biomass was
estimated non-destructively. In the most wave-exposed deep-water
population thalli were twice as long with more than twice the
biomass than in the calmest deep-water population. Total density
and juvenile density were highest in the bay with intermediate
wave exposure. Depth was an important factor at both the
individual and population level. Shallow-water thalli had basal
holdfast areas that were four times larger than those from deep
water, and thallus biomass was positively correlated with
holdfast area. Shallow-water juveniles invested more in the
development of a holdfast and lateral growth than deep-water
juveniles. Total biomass per quadrat was up to 10-fold higher in
shallow- than in deep-water populations. In shallow-water
populations reproductive thalli were present throughout the year
whereas in deep-water populations they were present only during
autumn and winter. We conclude that both wave exposure and depth
affect population structure. Thalli were generally bigger and
total biomass higher in the more exposed bay(s) and in shallower
water, contradicting the general pattern in macroalgae of reduced
size and biomass with increasing wave exposure.},

abstract = {The common assumption that the energy of waves on a non-uniform
current U is propagated with a velocity (U + c) where cg is the
group-velocity, and that no further interaction takes place, is
shown in this paper to be incorrect. In fact the current does
additional work on the waves at a rate $\gamma$ijSij where $\gamma$ij is the
symmetric rate-of-strain tensor associated with the current, and
Sij is the radiation stress tensor introduced earlier
(Longuet-Higgins {\&} Stewart 1960).In the present paper we first
obtain an asymptotic solution for the combined velocity
potential in the simple case (1) when the non-uniform current U
is in the direction of wave propagation and the horizontal
variation of U is compensated by a vertical upwelling from
below. The change in wave amplitude is shown to be such as would
be found by inclusion of the radiation stress term.In a second
example (2) the current on the x-axis is assumed to be as in
(1), but the horizontal variation in U is compensated by a small
horizontal inflow from the sides. It is found that in that case
the wave amplitude is also affected by the horizontal advection
of wave energy from the sides.From cases (1) and (2) the general
law of interaction between short waves and non-uniform currents
is inferred. This is then applied to a third example (3) when
waves encounter a current with vertical axis of shear, at an
oblique angle. The change in wave amplitude is shown to differ
somewhat from the previously accepted value.The conclusion that
non-linear interactions affect the amplification of the waves
has some bearing on the theoretical efficiency of hydraulic and
pneumatic breakwaters.},

abstract = {Dramatic shifts in community composition occur between vertical
and horizontal rocky surfaces in subtidal environments worldwide,
yet the forces mediating this transition are poorly understood.
Vertical rock walls are often covered by lush, diverse
communities of sessile suspension-feeding invertebrates, while
adjacent horizontal substrates are dominated by algae, or corals
in the tropics. Multiple factors, including light, sedimentation,
water flow, and predation have been proposed to explain this
pattern, but experimental tests of these hypotheses are lacking.
We manipulated light level and predation to test whether
variation in these mechanisms could be responsible for the shift
in composition of sessile communities between vertical and
horizontal surfaces in the rocky subtidal Gulf of Maine. Shaded
horizontally oriented granite plots were dominated by
invertebrates (e.g., ascidians, barnacles, bryozoans) after 25
months. Unshaded plots were dominated by macroalgae, which was
virtually absent in shaded plots. Exclusion of grazers with cages
had no effect on percent cover of invertebrates or algae.
Preferential settlement of invertebrate larvae to shaded plots,
due to larval behaviors such as negative phototaxis, did not seem
to play a role. Shading likely affects post-settlement mortality
of invertebrates by alleviating competition for space with algae,
although greater abundance of micropredators in algal- dominated
communities could also be important. Communities on shaded plots
lacked many taxa present on natural wall communities, likely due
to greater disturbance on horizontal substrates and/or lack of
sufficient time for colonization of these taxa. These results
suggest that light plays a key role in controlling the structure,
composition, and function of shallow subtidal communities.},

sustain turnover of the entire pool of organic carbon dissolved

degraded, nitrogen-poor remains of terrestrial organisms, it
might be expected to suffer minimal respiration in the ocean. One
of the biggest mysteries in the global carbon cycle, therefore,
is that only a small fraction of the organic matter dissolved in
seawater and preserved in marine sediments appears to be
land-derived. Either our global budgets and distribution
estimates are greatly in error, or both dissolved and particulate
organic matter of terrestrial origin suffer rapid and remarkably
extensive remineralization at sea. Although many uncertainties
remain, recent studies provide growing evidence for destruction
of both dissolved and particulate terrestrial organic matter in

exposed sandy beaches as ecosystems is their almost complete lack
of in situ primary production (e.g. Brown, 1964; Munro et al.,

mobility of the sediments, which renders them unsuitable for the
attachment of macrophytes or the development of dense benthic
diatom communities. In the absence of these potential food
resources macrofaunal organisms on exposed beaches must obtain
their nutrition from imported materials. These may take the form
of finely divided detritus or phytoplankton particles, many of
which may originate from rich blooms of phytoplankton in the surf
zone (McLachlan et al., 1981b), or large items of carrion. The
macro-fauna associated with these food resources normally
comprises two major trophic elements, namely filter feeders,
including bivalves (such as Donax) and crustacea (such as Emenita
and Gastnosaccub); and predator/scavengers (e.g. Bullia,
Ocypode,various isopods and polychaetes). The proportion of these
two trophic elements differs widely, depending on the relative
availability of plankton and detritus versus carrion (McLachlan
et al., 1981a), but filter feeding bivalves are frequently the
overwhelming dominants in terms of biomass (e.g. McLachlan et

meters and optical backscatter sensors were deployed directly in
front of a seawall at Teignmouth, South Devon (U.K.) in June
1995. Similar instruments were deployed simultaneously on the
adjacent natural beach. Reflection coefficients were in the
range 0.7 to 1.0 at the wall and around 0.2 on the natural beach
for incident wave frequencies (0.125-0.36 Hz). Reflection
coefficients at lower frequencies (0.04-0.125 Hz), were close to
unity at the wall, whilst on the beach the reflection
coefficient increased with decreasing frequency, reaching 0.9 at
the low frequency spectral peak. Both sediment suspension and
transport were altered significantly by the presence of the
wall. Mean suspended sediment concentrations were found to be up
to three times larger in front of the wall than on the natural
beach. This increase was attributed to the increase in wave
reflection. The largest differences occurred when the waves were
largest, and the water was shallow. A net onshore sediment
transport by incident waves was observed on the natural beach.
In front of the wall, this net oscillatory transport was
considerably reduced. The longshore current in front of the wall

corresponding neighbor-joining phylograms is positively
associated with the number of microsatellites utilized. For
instance, increasing the number of loci from six to 17 resulted
in a striking 75{\%} increase in the proportion of DCE phylogram
nodes supported by a bootstrap estimate of over 70{\%}. Our results
demonstrate that even moderately increasing the number of loci
can be very beneficial--a finding extremely relevant for studies
of natural populations for which optimally high microsatellite
numbers are out of reach. Furthermore, the number of loci most
commonly used to date may lead to erroneous inference of the
evolutionary relationships between populations.},

abstract = {Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6 degrees C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

abstract = {San Diego's sewage outfall broke during winter 1992, spilling 7.1 x I@ litresld of treated efJEuent in kelp forest depths for a two month period during an El Nirio event. The ecological implicationsfor the Point Loma kelp forest community were studied by comparing long term data with conditions during and after the spill. Surface ammonium concentrations within 1 km of the break were at potentially toxic levels, and light levels were reduced enough to have inhibited kelp germination and growth. However, because of El Nin”o conditions, it is unlikely that kelp would have germinated in the absence of a spill. Beyond 1 km, high ammonium concentrations benefitted the nutrient-depleted surface canopy of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Measured sedimentation rates were significantly higher near the outfall during the spill and were strongly related to wave height; water motion, however, prevented sediment accumulation. Bioassays were conducted on a grid of stations surrounding the outfall. There were sign{\$}cant reductions in the density and growth of microscopic sporophytes of Macrocystis out- planted near the outfall during the spill, but this pattern disappeared in samples collected 11 dafter the repair was completed and was not observed again. Sediments collected near the outfall during the spill significantly reduced Macrocystis germ tube elongation; a post repair assay showed no dtflerences with respect to the outfall. No sign{\$}cant effects were observed in outplants of juvenile Macrocystis sporophytes, cup corals, and juvenile abalones. Video transects during the spill and subsequent diving observations provided no evidence of sediment accumulation or negative impacts on *To whom correspondence should be addressed. 181 182 M. J. Tegner et al. established animal populations. Kelp population dynamics at the permanent sites were predictable from existing population structure and El NiZo condi- tions. Damage to kelps, apparently resulting from a combination of low light and nutrient conditions with mechanical damage from storms, construction activity, and barge anchor cables, was observed along the outfall immedi- ately adjacent to the break point. Shortly after the outfall was repaired, upwelling improved conditions for kelp germination and growth, and the zone of maximum impact developed into a dense kelp forest. Suspension feeders, detritivores and sea urchins, whose natural history indicates they could have been aflected by the spill, showed no unusual population changes. In the context of the continuum of disturbances observed in two decades of population studies at Point Loma, the spill was a modest disturbance simi- lar to the natural vagaries of kelp recruitment. We emphasize that this spill was an intense but not chronic impact during an El Nina event that also stressed control areas. However, it is representative of massive spills in coastal regions, and the fact that a sewage spill of this magnitude had no lasting eflects on a kelp forest community is of general interest},

abstract = {Communities worldwide are increasingly affected by natural
hazards such as floods, droughts, wildfires and storm-waves.
However, the causes of these increases remain underexplored,
often attributed to climate changes or changes in the patterns
of human exposure. This paper aims to quantify the effect of
climate change, as well as land cover change, on a suite of
natural hazards. Changes to four natural hazards (floods,
droughts, wildfires and storm-waves) were investigated through
scenario-based models using land cover and climate change
drivers as inputs. Findings showed that human-induced land cover
changes are likely to increase natural hazards, in some cases
quite substantially. Of the drivers explored, the uncontrolled
spread of invasive alien trees was estimated to halve the
monthly flows experienced during extremely dry periods, and also
to double fire intensities. Changes to plantation forestry
management shifted the 1:100 year flood event to a 1:80 year
return period in the most extreme scenario. Severe 1:100 year
storm-waves were estimated to occur on an annual basis with only
modest human-induced coastal hardening, predominantly from
removal of coastal foredunes and infrastructure development.
This study suggests that through appropriate land use management
(e.g. clearing invasive alien trees, re-vegetating clear-felled
forests, and restoring coastal foredunes), it would be possible
to reduce the impacts of natural hazards to a large degree. It
also highlights the value of intact and well-managed landscapes
and their role in reducing the probabilities and impacts of
extreme climate events.},

We {\textregistered}rst assessed the importance of phlorotannins as chemical defences against epiphytes by (a) correlating epiphyte loads on different parts of the thallus with the phlorotannin content of those tissues, and (b) experimentally testing the effects of variation in phlorotannin concentration against the settlement and growth of gametes of Ulva lactuca, a common epiphyte in the system. Tissue phlorotannin content was, at best, only weakly related to epiphyte loads, with r2 values typically {\textless}0.10. Inhibition of Ulva gametes only occurred at concentrations {\textgreater}10 mg l)1, which is 5 orders of magnitude greater than levels of phlorotannins in the water column around beds of E. radiata, and 1±3 orders of magnitude greater than estimated levels in the boundary layer at the surface of the plant. We concluded that phlorotannins have a negligible impact on patterns of epiphytism on E. radiata, and proceeded to investigate other factors in¯uencing the distribution and abundance of epiphytes. In our samples the relative age of different parts of the thallus was strongly correlated with epiphyte abundance, with epiphyte densities greatest on the oldest tissue and least on the youngest. Distal parts of the thalli also had greater epiphyte loads than basal parts. Field experiments in which kelp tissue was suspended at two heights in an E. radiata forest for varying lengths of time con{\textregistered}rmed the importance of the length of time that the tissue was in the water, and its height in the water column, to the development of an epiphyte community. Comparison of epiphyte loads on tissue from primary (smooth) and secondary (rough) laminae in these experiments indicated that surface rugosity also affected fouling. Macroherbivores were rare on E. radiata, and abundances of mesofauna andepiphytes were positively related, suggesting that grazers were not important determinants of patterns of epiphyte abundance. Although phlorotannins have been previously suggested to play an important role as defences against epiphytes, we suggest that water-soluble compounds such as phlorotannins are less likely to be effective defences against epiphytes than non-polar metabolites, which can adhere to the surface of the producing organism.},

the 124 records listed for the country come from a 1974 British
Natural History Museum expedition to the central and southern
parts of that country. Previous biogeographic studies treated the
Angolan seaweed flora as a whole and grouped it with those of
certain West African islands as transitional between a Tropical
West African seaweed flora (essentially extending from Senegal to
Gabon) and temperate floras to the north and south of this truly
tropical region. In the present study a total of 99 species and
subspecies of seaweeds was collected from the intertidal zone and
shallow sublittoral zones at five sites in the north of Angola
and four sites in the south. The biogeographic distributions of
our records were examined and compared with the temperate flora
of Namibia to the south and the flora of Ghana to the north (as
an example of a well-studied Tropical West African flora).
Multivariate analyses of our presence/absence records showed
differences between northern and southern sites (cluster analysis
[Jaccard, average linkage] and detrended correspondence
analysis). All Angolan sites were clearly different from floras
of south, central and northern Namibia, which are considered to
be strictly temperate in nature. Northern Angolan sites grouped
more closely with Ghana than with southern Angolan sites.
Distribution patterns within Angola are discussed in relation to
monthly sea surface temperature data that were processed for this
region. We conclude that the overall affinities of the Angolan
seaweed flora, as represented by our collections, are Tropical
West African, but with a well-developed temperate element in
southern Angola (from about 13° S) comprising mainly cooler-water
species from the Benguela Marine Province of Namibia and western
South Africa. Our collections add about 45 species to the Angolan
seaweed flora, raising the total number of species to around 169.
This total approaches that of Ghana which, with about 200
species, is considered to have the richest seaweed flora in

The present study was prompted by a proposal for the establishment of an E. Chloroticus fishery in Dusky Sound, Fiordland, New Zealand. To determine the ecological importance of E. Chloroticus in Dusky Sound, sea urchins were experimentally removed from shallow fucoid fringe (upper zone), mid-depth barrens (middle zone), and deeper algal meadow (lower zone), at eight sites and compared with a paired set of eight control sites. Two years of continuous removal of E. Chloroticus resulted in conspicuous changes to the algal community at all depth zones examined. The density of fucoid algae (Carpophyllum spp., Sargassum spp., Cystophora spp., and Landsburgia quercifolia) increased mostly in the upper and middle zones, although smaller increases were also observed in the lower zone. Changes in cover of herbaceous, turfing and crustose algae observed in the middle and lower zones were larger than in the upper zone. Density increases of the kelp Ecklonia radiata were observed mainly in the lower zone, although still important in the middle zone. These results show that E. Chloroticus can have a strong influence on the structure of algal assemblages in Dusky Sound hence the development of an E. Chloroticus fishery in this area should be treated with caution.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Patterns of potential recruitment, survival, age-structure, density, biomass and primary production were studied in the kelp Laminaria hyperborea along a wave-exposure gradient in western Norway. The distribution of L. hyperborea is positively related to wave exposure, and the present work aimed to study how demography and population dynamics are affected by wave exposure. Populations at 9 sites representing 3 different levels of wave exposure were investigated. The biomass and production of L. hyperborea doubled along the gradient from low- to high-exposure sites. This increase was caused by an increase in plant density and individual plant size. Recruits and sub-canopy plants made up the majority of all individuals at all sites, but potential recruitment increased more than mortality rate among recruits and young sub-canopy plants as wave exposure increased, leading to a higher density of these small individuals at high-exposure sites. Despite their large numbers, recruits and sub-canopy plants were not important for total biomass and production, and variations in those parameters with wave exposure were largely driven by variations in the density and size of adult canopy plants. Canopy plants suffered higher rates of mortality at low wave exposure, leading to shorter longevity and lower density than at high-exposure sites. The density and individual size of canopy plants both increased by ca. 50{\%} with increasing wave exposure, explaining the higher biomass and productivity at high-exposure sites. We suggest that the high mortality rate, low density and small size of canopy plants at low-exposure sites is caused by a combination of high epiphytic load and self-shading, which may impair light conditions, affect nutrient uptake and increase drag on the blades during extreme wind events. The reason why plants at high-exposure sites reach a larger individual size remains unknown.},

photobiology following the modifications of light spectral
composition induced by the 'ozone depletion' in the atmosphere.
The consequences of this change on the macrophytic red algae,
which possess accessory light-harvesting complexes, are currently
uncertain. Moreover the underwater light field of coastal waters,
where most macroalgae are living, has been well characterized
only in the last few years. The presence and the variability of
light components, such as red, far-red, green, blue and
ultraviolet radiation, in these environments, at different
depths, have raised the question of whether red macroalgae are
'light-intensity or/and light-quality adapters'. In this paper
various adaptive responses of red algae, both in the field and
under culture, are discussed in order to compare the
physiological and ecological results. All these studies seem to
suggest that red algae are both 'light-intensity and
light-quality adapters'. In particular, the light quality and,
overall, the modulation of the ratios between spectral components
seem to play the role of photomorphogenic 'signals' regulating
algal metabolism and growth. Short- and long-term responses, and
potential strategies and mechanisms for adaptation to light at
individual, cellular and molecular levels, are discussed with
special reference to the photosynthetic equipment. (C) 2000

abstract = {The rock lobster Jasus lalandii expanded its centre of distribution south-eastwards into an area known as ‘East of Cape Hangklip' on the south-west coast of South Africa in the early 1990s. Using histori- cal and present data, we analysed differences in the abundance of key species and functional groups between the pre- and post-rock lobster invasion periods at two sites along that coast: Cape Hangklip and Betty's Bay. Pre-1989, lobsters were absent, but after 1995 they reached densities approximat- ing 0.4–0.8 m–2 . Benthic community composition also changed significantly with herbivores being abundant whereas macroalgae and sessile invertebrates were scarce pre-invasion. We attribute the decline of herbivores to the direct effects of lobster predation, in turn indirectly promoting macroalgae. Post-invasion sessile invertebrates and macroalgae increased by 2 600{\%} and 453{\%} respectively, whereas herbivores declined by 99.3{\%}. The virtual elimination of the sea urchin Parechinus angulo- sus by rock lobsters has substantial implications for the commercial harvesting of the abalone Haliotis midae, because its juveniles are intimately associated with this urchin. The lobster invasion has thus not only led to a regime shift of the ecosystem but has also substantial economic consequences, which calls for an ecosystem approach to the management of the pool of commercially exploited resources in this region.

correct properties are being modelled. The linkage arrangements
and the extent of their variability and responses to local
environmental change are examined using two webs from
observations at Cape Flattery, Washington State and Torch Bay,
Alaska. It is concluded that enumerating links through direct
observations provides little information on a particular species'
importance and the connecting component of food webs is
susceptible to enormous geographic and within habitat variations.
What counts is the competitive stature of the preferred prey,
implying that cross-links will be as important as trophic ones.
The evidence for strong interactions and some of their
consequences as a unit are discussed. Basic data are given on 3
experiments in the marine environment that reveal the difficulty
of examining weak interactions. The author concludes that trophic
links are unequal in strength, and most benthic and aquatic
communities seem to be characterized by high variance in this
measure. Strong links ar easily demonstrated experimentally and
their presence readily explains the cascading changes that
characterize certain altered ecosystems. Further, predictable
strong linkage can generate trophically different but persistent
alternative resource bases. These later appear not to develop
when the strong interaction is unpredictable in space or time.
Finally, predictable strong interactions can encourage the
development of modules or subsystems embedded within the
community nexus. The individuals comprising these may be
co-adapted to one another and exhibit sophisticated mutualisms.},

abstract = {Two ecological paradigms, the trophic cascade and the host-density threshold in disease, interact in the kelp-forest ecosystem to structure the community. To investigate what happens when a trophic cascade pushes a host population over a host-threshold density, I analyzed a 10-year data set of kelp forest communities at 16 sites in the region of the Channel Islands National Park, CA, USA. Historically, lobsters, and perhaps other predators, kept urchin populations at low levels and kelp forests developed a community-level trphic cascade. In geographic areas where the main predators on urchins were fished, urchin populations increased to the extent that they overgrazed algage and starvation eventually limited urchin-population growth. Despite the limitation of urchin population size by food availability, urchin densities, at times, well exceeded the host-density threshold for epidemics. An urchin-specific bacterial disease entered the region after 1992 and acted as a density dependent mortality source. Dense populations were more likely to experience epidemics and suffer higher mortality. Disease did not reduce the urchin population at a site to the density that prediators previously did.

occur with canopy removal in winter. Laboratory experiments
revealed that the UV component of radiation, rather than intense
photosynthetically active radiation, was responsible for the
inhibition of growth and photodamage. UV radiation probably
affects survival of the settlement stages of E. radiata

This technology is simple to use, inexpensive, and timely in producing aerial photographs of marine areas. Both technical details regarding aerial photos acquisition (drone and camera settings) and post processing workflow (3D model generation with Structure From Motion algorithm and photo-stitching) are given.

abstract = {Two species of rock lobster (Palinuridae) are commonly found in coastal waters around both New Zealand and Australia. Both species have a relatively long larval phase, which raises the question of how populations can be maintained in regions where the mean flow advects larvae away from the coast. Previous work shows that Jasus edwardsii is genetically indistinguishable between Australia and New Zealand, whereas Sagmariasus verreauxi may be genetically different between the 2 countries. Satellite altimeter data are used here to test the hypothesis that Australia acts as a source of larvae for some New Zealand populations, and to investigate if there is a physical mechanism for the apparent lack of gene flow for S. verreauxi. A Lagrangian approach is used in which the western Tasman Sea is seeded with numerical drifters to build up a statistical summary of the likely distribution of larval trajectories. Ignoring biological factors, about 9{\%} of J. edwardsii and about 2{\%} of S. verreauxi larvae might be expected to arrive in New Zealand waters within their respective larval lifetimes. An order-of-magnitude estimate shows that even with extremely high mortality, these rates are high enough for trans-Tasman larval flow to contribute to and possibly maintain some New Zealand populations. Larval flow across the Tasman Sea should be sufficient to maintain trans- Tasman genetic homogeneity in both species. We suggest that 1 reason that S. verreauxi may not be genetically homogenous is that in order to arrive in New Zealand within 1 larval lifetime, they have to cross the Tasman Sea north of the productive Subtropical Front where there is not enough prey to sustain them},

abstract = {In this review the most recent contributions to the field of
molecular ecology and biogeography of mangrove trees are
considered. Emphasis is on the obtained information of the
different molecular marker methods used in mangrove genetics and
on the potential to infer biogeographical patterns. Isozymes on
average showed low or even no polymorphism in mangrove trees
similar as known in seagrasses. The outcrossing Avicennia seems
to be the most variable mangrove tree for isozymes. Both low
amounts of interpretable allozymes and difficulties in
maintaining the enzyme activity have reduced the number of
successful studies during the isozyme era. Dominant marker
methods (RAPD, AFLP and ISSR) were successful to demonstrate
differences in amplified DNA products at large-scale geographical
distances within Avicennia species and to estimate species
relationships. Hybrid testing seldom revealed hybridization among
tree species. The most promising markers (microsatellites or SSR)
were only recently developed and will continue to provide
evidence in future studies. SSR loci in Avicennia seem to show
relatively low levels of polymorphism, though clearly
demonstrating that populations located at the edge of the species
range can be even more depauperated. Populations located more
central in their native range and situated along the same
coastline such as reported in Rhizophora, are expected to be only
weakly differentiated due to increased levels of gene flow.
Haplotypic chloroplast variants (PCR-RFLP) or sequences revealed
strong genetic structuring between populations of Avicennia,
Kandelia and Ceriops from different biogeographical oceanic
regions. Recent views on long-distance dispersal and on gene flow
across oceans as well as along the same coastline are discussed.
A comparative analysis on genetic variables across species and
regions indicated general trends in the partitioning of genetic
variation. A conceptual map with a worldwide overview of those
regions where high levels of gene flow were reported and of other
regions that were considered as effective barriers, is presented.
As an aim to increase the number of reliable comparisons of
genetic variables across species or regions and to increase the
relevance of mangrove genetics for local conservation issues,
recommendations on the molecular markers and on the sampling
design of individuals and populations are given within a
conceptual context of evolutionary significant units. ?? 2008

estimating patterns of gene flow and in reconstructing
biogeographic history, particularly when gene genealogies can be

as mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA often consist of
geographically separated clades that come into contact in narrow
regions. Such phylogeographic breaks are usually assumed to be
the result of long-term barriers to gene flow. Here I show that
deep phylogeographic breaks can form within a continuously
distributed species even when there are no barriers to gene flow.
The likelihood of observing phylogeographic breaks increases as
the average individual dispersal distance and population size
decrease. Those molecular markers that are most likely to show
evidence of real geographic barriers are also most likely to show
phylogeographic breaks that formed without any barrier to gene
flow. These results might provide an explanation as to why some

chloroplast DNA that do not coincide with sudden changes in other

importance. A number of valuable species on these subtidal reefs

@article{Le_Hir2007-sd,
abstract = {Sediment erosion results from hydrodynamic forcing, represented
by the bottom shear stress (BSS), and from the erodability of
the sediment, defined by the critical erosion shear stress and
the erosion rate. Abundant literature has dealt with the effects
of biological components on sediment erodability and concluded
that sediment processes are highly sensitive to the biota.
However, very few sediment transport models account for these
effects. We provide some background on the computation of BSS,
and on the classical erosion laws for fine sand and mud,
followed by a brief review of biota effects with the aim of
quantifying the latter into generic formulations, where
applicable. The effects of macrophytes, microphytobenthos, and
macrofauna are considered in succession. Marine vegetation
enhances the bottom dissipation of current energy, but also
reduces shear stress at the sediment–water interface, which can
be significant when the shoot density is high. The
microphytobenthos and secreted extracellular polymeric
substances (EPS) stabilise the sediment, and an increase of up
to a factor of 5 can be assigned to the erosion threshold on
muddy beds. However, the consequences with respect to the
erosion rate are debatable since, once the protective biofilm is
eroded, the underlying sediment probably has the same erosion
behaviour as bare sediment. In addition, the development of
benthic diatoms tends to be seasonal, so that stabilising
effects are likely to be minimal in winter. Macrofaunal effects
are characterised by extreme variability. For muddy sediments,
destabilisation seems to be the general trend; this can become
critical when benthic communities settle on consolidated
sediments that would not be eroded if they remained bare.
Biodeposition and bioresuspension fluxes are mentioned, for
comparison with hydrodynamically induced erosion rates. Unlike
the microphytobenthos, epifaunal benthic organisms create local
roughness and are likely to change the BSS generated by the
flow. In this paper, we attempt to describe state-of-the-art
sediment transport models accounting for biological processes.
Such applications generally demonstrate a clear effect of the
biota on erosion/deposition, but morphodynamic coupling is
rarely achieved. In the present study, a modelling exercise of
this type was run, based on a cross-shore morphodynamic model of
an intertidal mudflat [Waeles, B., Le Hir, P., Silva Jacinto,
R., 2004. Mod{\'{e}}lisation morphodynamique cross-shore d'un estran
vaseux. Comptes Rendus Geoscience 336, 1025–1033] in which the
equilibrium profile of the intertidal flat under tide and wave
forcing is simulated. A seasonal presence of the
microphytobenthos in late spring and summer, represented by a
fourfold increase in the erosion threshold, generates sediment
level changes of about 5cm. However, these effects disappear in
autumn and winter when the erosion threshold returns to its
abiotic value, even when wave erosion is ignored. In contrast,
the reduction of BSS in the upper flat to simulate the effect of
a saltmarsh induces a spectacular seaward shift of the upper
flat. The simulations show the strong, potential, long-term
effect of vegetated beds, i.e. the protection of sediment from
wave erosion. In contrast, local stabilisation by the
microphytobenthos does not have a significant long-term effect.
Some recommendations are given on the need to define
experimental protocols for erosion tests and studies on biota
effects. A stochastic approach is suggested to cope with the
problem of patchiness and extreme variability of erodability
patterns, combined with histograms of BSS.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was used to study the relative impact of (1) vegetation, (2) micro-topography, and (3) water level fluctuations on the spatial flow and sedimentation patterns in a tidal marsh landscape during single inundation events. The model incorporates three-dimensional (3-D) effects of vegetation on the flow (drag and turbulence). After extensive calibration and validation against field data, the model showed that the 3-D vegetation structure is determinant for the flow and sedimentation patterns. As long as the water level is below the top of the vegetation, differences in flow resistance between vegetated and unvegetated areas result in faster flow routing over unvegetated areas, so that vegetated areas are flooded from unvegetated areas, with flow directions more or less perpendicular to the vegetation edge. At the vegetation edge, flow velocities are reduced and sediments are rapidly trapped. In contrast, in between vegetated areas, flow velocities are enhanced, resulting in reduced sedimentation or erosion. As the water level overtops the vegetation, the flow paths described above change to more large-scale sheet flow crossing both vegetated and unvegetated areas. As a result, sedimentation patterns are then spatially more homogeneous. Our results suggest that the presence of a vegetation cover is the key factor controlling the long-term geomorphic development of tidal marsh landforms, leading to the formation of (1) unvegetated tidal channels and (2) vegetated platforms with a levee-basin topography in between these channels.},

abundance during the interval between 1979 and 2006, including
Mycteroperca microlepis (gag grouper, up ? 200?), Lutjanus

the past. Additionally, we observed regional increases in air and
sea surface temperatures (43 1C) during the ? 30 years that
separate Livingston's samples and ours that correlate with
northern shifts in the distribution of warm-water fishes.
Documenting these range shifts is a critical first step in
investigating the consequences of globalwarming for endemic

collected seven species of Caribbean reef corals and also
representative macroalgae from reefs near Lee Stocking Island,
Bahamas and quantified their pigments using high performance
liquid chromatography. We also measured the fluorescence and
reflectance spectra of corals and macroalgae using an in situ
benthic spectrofluorometer. In visibly pigmented (unbleached)
coral from 4 to 5 m depth, the mean (±SD) surface density of
pigments (3.0±1.3 $\mu$g chlorophyll-a cm-2 and 2.1±0.7 $\mu$g peridinin
cm-2) was similar between colonies of the same species, but
differed among species. The mean quantity of pigment per
zooxanthella (1.8±0.9 pg chl-a cell-1 and 1.4±0.7 pg peridinin
cell-1) also differed among species and sometimes between
colonies of the same species. Chl-a and peridinin densities per
surface area of coral were positively correlated. When excited
with blue light (480 nm), macroalgae and corals had typical
chlorophyll fluorescence with a peak at 680 nm and a smaller
shoulder peak at 730 to 740 nm. Most corals, unlike macroalgae,
also had distinct fluorescence peaks between 500 and 530 nm. In
visibly bleached corals 680 nm fluorescence was greatly reduced
in amplitude. Pigmented coral, under natural lighting
conditions, had a reflected light peak at about 570 nm.
Reflectance increased over all wavelengths in bleached corals,
with the greatest increase at the wavelengths where chlorophyll
and accessory pigments absorb light, i.e. 670 and 450 to 550 nm.
Both fluorescence and reflectance spectra appear promising to
remotely differentiate between pigmented and bleached coral and
between coral and macroalgae.},

abstract = {Vegetated coastal habitats have been identified as important
carbon sinks. In contrast to angiosperm-based habitats such as
seagrass meadows, salt marshes and mangroves, marine macroalgae
have largely been excluded from discussions of marine carbon
sinks. Macroalgae are the dominant primary producers in the
coastal zone, but they typically do not grow in habitats that
are considered to accumulate large stocks of organic carbon.
However, the presence of macroalgal carbon in the deep sea and
sediments, where it is effectively sequestered from the
atmosphere, has been reported. A synthesis of these data
suggests that macroalgae could represent an important source of
the carbon sequestered in marine sediments and the deep ocean.
We pro- pose two main modes for the transport of macroalgae to
the deep ocean and sediments: macroalgal material drifting
through submarine canyons, and the sinking of negatively buoyant
macroalgal detritus. A rough estimate suggests that macroalgae
could sequester about 173 TgC yr–1 (with a range of 61–268 TgC
yr–1 ) globally. About 90{\%} of this sequestration occurs through
export to the deep sea, and the rest through burial in coastal
sediments. This estimate exceeds that for carbon sequestered in
angiosperm-based coastal habitats.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The mechanisms by which non-indigenous species overcome resistance in native communities are not well understood but are fundamental to the ability of invaders to persist and spread once they reach alien shores. One of the most widespread invaders is the kelp Undaria pinnatifida. Here we test disturbance, competition and facilitation in its recruitment into intertidal algal communities in southern New Zealand. In field-based experiments, we manipulated native fucoid and U. pinnatifida canopies, as well as the abundance and type of understory turfing species, and provided various gap sizes in native communities. Undaria pinnatifida recruitment occurred almost exclusively on coralline turf and in the absence of canopies, both native and conspecific. Where the native fucoid canopy was removed, U. pinnatifida recruited into gaps of all sizes (5 × 5 cm, 25 × 25 cm, 50 × 50 cm), but the smallest gaps recovered their native canopy within several months and precluded further recruitment. Experimental manipulations of coralline turf showed that recruitment of U. pinnatifida was orders of magnitude greater where turf was present, regardless of the timing or sizes of clearances. Facilitation did not occur with other turfing species. Overall, native fucoids showed high resistance to invasion, but there was great facilitation by native coralline turf. Furthermore, as annual U. pinnatifida canopies disappear over summer, it is clear that coralline turf harbors the microscopic stages of U. pinnatifida that will form the following year's populations. As turfing species increase and persist following disturbances of native canopies worldwide, it can be expected that the recruitment dynamics of non-indigenous species will also change.},

abstract = {Geographical morphological variations in Fucus vesiculosus populations were studied along the coast of Iceland. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on 11 morphological characters clustered the 26 sampling sites into four different morphological types as follows: (1) a morphological type found along the S-SW-W coast; (2) an intermediate form comprising only two populations in the NW; (3) a type found along the N-NE-E-SE coast; and (4) a type found independent of geographical area, in estuaries and at sites influenced by large freshwater outflows. Populations influenced by low salinity had significantly (P≤0.001) shorter thalli, a shorter distance from the holdfast to the oldest dichotomy, smaller fronds, narrower stipes and midrib width compared to the morphology of all other more saline populations. No significant difference in frond width was found between the S-SW-W and the N-NE-E-SE populations. However, significant (P ≤ 0.001) morphological differences between them were observed, the former having shorter thalli, a greater distance from the holdfast to the oldest dichotomy, narrower stipes and smaller midrib width compared to the latter. These differences between populations along the S-SW-W and the N-NE-E-SE coasts are suggested to be due to combined effects of rare, long distance dispersal of reproductive fronds by the warm-temperate Irminger Current and the cold, Arctic East Icelandic Current respectively and the short dispersal range of Fucus gametes. Thus, over the years, the East Icelandic Current may have transported reproductive fronds from the northernmost F. vesiculosus populations on the Greenland coast and the Barents Sea to the eastern coast of Iceland while the Irminger Current has carried thalli from the more southerly distribution of Fucus on the North American east coast to the southwestern part of Iceland. Excluding the populations affected by reduced salinity, the comparatively similar morphology within these two areas, may be explained by the restricted dispersal of the short lived F. vesiculosus gametes.},

model accounting for vegetation-induced turbulence production is
implemented to study turbulent flow within the vegetation field.
The model is calibrated and validated using experimental data

breaking random wave propagation in vegetation fields. It is
found that the drag-related coefficients in the k−ϵ model Cfk

change the wave attenuation rate. The bulk drag coefficient CD
is the major parameter controlling surface wave damping by
vegetation canopies. Using the empirical formula of Mendez and
Losada (2004), the present model provides accurate predictions
of vegetation-induced wave energy dissipation. Wave propagation
through a finite patch of vegetation in the surf zone is
investigated as well. It is found that the presence of a finite

species' attachment properties are similar between seasons and
sites. We tested this assumption using Hedophyllum sessile to
investigate how macroalgal biomechanical attachment properties
vary with developmental stage, substratum-type, season, and
wave-exposure. Hedophyllum sessile is an intertidal kelp species
that is able to survive in wave-exposed areas in the Northeast
Pacific. For both juveniles and adults, holdfast attachment
force and strength were measured at a wave-exposed and
wave-protected site in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada.
Substratum and wave-exposure effects on attachment properties
were tested in juvenile populations. Adult populations were
sampled prior to (in July 1996) and after (in November 1996) a
series of storms. Site and seasonal wave-exposure effects on
attachment properties were tested in these adult populations.
Comparisons to known attachment properties of other temperate
macroalgal species were also made. Causes for these patterns are
discussed but were not isolated in these studies. Juveniles'
attachment properties differed on different substrata types and
between wave-exposures, with the highest attachment forces and
the most attached juveniles in articulated coralline algal
turfs. Adult attachment is firm (∼100 N), but relatively weak
(∼0.07 MNm−2). Adult attachment did not vary with site
wave-exposure, but there was a shift within each site to more
resistant holdfasts after a series of early winter storms.
Seasonal increases in storm swells correlated to more thallus
tattering and selected against large, loose holdfasts. The data
presented here suggest that results from holdfast attachment
field studies in one season cannot be extrapolated to another
due to a complex set of dynamics. This is the first
documentation of seasonal patterns in macroalgal attachment

The potential of metabolic fingerprinting for discriminating . Myriophyllum spicatum individuals growing in different lakes under varying environmental conditions was explored to determine its applicability in an ecological context. Low molecular weight compounds from hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts of leaves from individual plants were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with subsequent data preprocessing of the mass-to-charge fragments of metabolites using XCMS. Multivariate analysis was used to compare the metabolite composition of the plants in space and time at a fingerprint level. The technical variation in the signals was low compared with the biological variation between individuals. Variation of the metabolite composition of aquatic macrophytes retrieved at one site at a particular time was within the same range as described for algae and plants grown under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Thus, metabolic fingerprinting of . M. spicatum growing in the field is reproducible and biological responses can be detected. As a " proof-of-principle" , the approach was applied to study individuals from two lake populations, as well as one population over a three week flowering period. Distinct metabolic fingerprints were found for the individuals from two lakes and were shown to be associated with the nutrient status of these lakes. For the population characterized over time, metabolic fingerprints of individuals seem to be related to their state of ontogenetic development. These results suggest that the lake water chemistry is reflected in the metabolite composition of the submerged macrophytes and that developmental changes may lead to metabolic alterations. We consider metabolic fingerprinting to be suitable for studying physiological processes of aquatic macrophytes in their habitat and potentially applicable for environmental monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Floating seaweeds play important ecological roles in offshore
waters. Recently, large amounts of rafting seaweed have been
observed in the East China Sea. In early spring, juveniles of
commercially important fish such as yellowtail accompany these
seaweed rafts. Because the spatial distributions of seaweed
rafts in the spring are poorly understood, research cruises were
undertaken to investigate them in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Floating
seaweed samples collected from the East China Sea during the
three surveys contained only Sargassum horneri. In 2010 and
2011, seaweed rafts were distributed only in the continental
shelf and the Kuroshio Front because they had become trapped in
the convergence zone of the Kuroshio Front. However, in 2012,
seaweed was also distributed in the Kuroshio Current and its
outer waters, and massive strandings of seaweed rafts were
observed on the northern coast of Taiwan and on Tarama Island in
the Ryukyu Archipelago. Environmental data (wind, currents, and
sea surface height) were compared among the surveys of 2010,
2011, and 2012. Two factors are speculated to have caused the
unusual distribution in 2012. First, a continuous strong north
wind produced an Ekman drift current that transported seaweed
southwestward to the continental shelf and eventually stranded
seaweed rafts on the coast of Taiwan. Second, an anticyclonic
eddy covering northeast Taiwan and the Kuroshio Current west of
Taiwan generated a geostrophic current that crossed the Kuroshio
Current and transported the rafts to the Kuroshio Current and
its outer waters. Such unusual seaweed distributions may
influence the distribution of fauna accompanying the rafts.},

abstract = {Aim  Twentieth century biogeographers developed intriguing hypotheses involving West Wind Drift dispersal of Southern Hemisphere biota, but such models were largely abandoned in favour of vicariance following the development of plate tectonic theory. Here I present a synthesis of southern temperate marine biogeography, and suggest some new directions for phylogeographic research. Location  The southern continents, formerly contiguous components of Gondwana, are now linked only by ocean currents driven by the West Wind Drift. Methods  While vicariance theory certainly facilitates the development of testable hypotheses, it does not necessarily follow that vicariance explains much of contemporary southern marine biogeography. To overcome the limitations of narratives that simply assume vicariance or dispersal, it is essential for analyses to test biogeographic hypotheses by incorporating genetic, ecological and geological data. Results  Recent molecular studies have provided strong evidence for dispersal, but relatively little evidence for the biogeographic role of plate tectonics in distributing southern marine taxa. Despite confident panbiogeographic claims to the contrary, molecular and ecological studies of buoyant macroalgae, such as Macrocystis, indicate that dispersal predominates. Ironically, some of the better supported evidence for marine vicariance in southern waters has little or nothing to do with plate tectonics. Rather, it involves far more localized and recent vicariant models, such as the isolating effect of the Bassian Isthmus during Pleistocene low sea-level stands (Nerita). Main conclusions  Recent phylogeographic studies of southern marine taxa (e.g. Diloma and Parvulastra) imply that passive rafting cannot be ignored as an important mechanism of long-distance dispersal. I outline a new direction for southern hemisphere phylogeography, involving genetic analyses of bull-kelp (Durvillaea) and its associated holdfast invertebrate communities.},

abstract = {Species composition reflects a combination of environmental and historical events at a site; hence, changes in species composition can provide a sensitive measure of ecologically relevant changes in the environment. Here, we consider the analysis of species composition when multiple sites are followed through time. Analyses of temporal trends in species composition either summarize species composition into a few metrics (indices or axis scores) or analyze the similarity among sites. We develop and illustrate the similarity approach. Each pair of samples represents a pair of replicates, a pair from the same site at different times, a pair from different sites at the same time, or an unrelated pair. Differences among times can be estimated by comparing average temporal dissimilarity to average replicate dissimilarity. Temporal trends can be described by one of three statistics that measure progressive change, the correlation of temporal dissimilarity with the length of time between samples. These methods are illustrated using data on changes in a South Carolina zooplankton assemblage following disturbance, and changes in bird species composition on Skokholm Island, Wales. It is difficult to define and interpret temporal trends. Some definitions of interesting trends, like increasing divergence from another set of sample plots, place additional requirements on the sampling design. Including replicate samples or clustering sample plots and including "control" plots for comparison with sentinel sites would contribute to an understanding of changes in species composition.},

@article{Hutchings2009-jb,
abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary
upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two
stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on
either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19–34°S),
which itself is subdivided at 26°S by the powerful Luderitz
upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the
boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history
cycle. While the ``Bakun triad'' of factors responsible for the
development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment,
concentration and retention) provide an important unifying
principle for understanding the compromise implicit in
adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been
neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The
role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of
shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is
being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so
strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to
distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of
several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the
1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the
north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a
subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling
system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle
upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate
productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated
from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The
northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system
with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and
moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted
state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during
the period 1970–1990, while hake have never fully recovered from
intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread
oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local
and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for
pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz–Orange River
Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong
winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute
a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source
water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone.
A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990
and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a
pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and
warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a
belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front.
Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely
affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery
ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank
and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west
coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the
Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an
upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal
stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic
upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A
large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer
season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic
levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal
upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an
important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution
and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy
populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5
years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment
of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history
patterns of these two species.},

netting monthly for 13 months. Twenty species of fish, 40 306
individuals weighing a total of 211 kg were captured. The number
of species and standing crop varied seasonally with higher

summer standing stock of 38{\textperiodcentered}6 g m−2 was considerably higher than
any previously recorded from a surf-zone habitat and the annual

Eighteen of the species sampled occurred almost exclusively as

throughout the year, 11 of them seasonally and the remaining
five sporadically. Small juveniles (20–35 mm) typically appeared
in the surf-zone 2–4 months after they were spawned. These 0+
juveniles remained there for between three months and one year

five species (Amblyrhynchotes honckenii, Cheilodonichthys

abstract = {Despite the great importance of shallow rocky communities ({\textless}30m deep) due to their contribution to the biodiversity of coastal waters, most efforts in ecological status assessment of marine waters have been carried out in the implementation of soft bottom biotic indices. Therefore, in this paper, a methodology for the environmental evaluation of coastal rocky communities for the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic), the CFR index (Quality of Rocky Bottoms), is presented. This index is based on the analysis of seaweed communities throughout the depth gradient, from the intertidal to the shallow subtidal, through the combination of a multimetric approach, which combines the richness of characteristic macroalgae populations, their total cover, the presence of opportunistic species and the physiological condition of the whole macroalgae community. Quality thresholds for these indicators are based on both ecological data and expert judgment. Finally, a preliminary application of this metric to sites with theoretically good and bad environmental conditions is used to analyze the suitability of the index. As a result, the four selected indicators responded in a significant way to the pressure gradient tested, proving to be appropriate for the type of pressure analysed and obtaining coherent results in the final quality assessment with the CFR index. In conclusion, the CFR index has proved to be an effective tool for the assessment of the ecological quality of coastal rocky communities, based on the analysis of macroalgae assemblages.},

abstract = {Buoyancy-driven boundary currents were generated in the
laboratory by releasing buoyant fluid from a source adjacent to
a vertical boundary in a rotating container. The boundary
removed the Coriolis force parallel to it, allowing the buoyant
fluid to spread in a current along the boundary. Ise of a
cylindrical boundary and a line source that released fluid
uniformly around the circumference enabled an axisymmetric
(zonal) current to be produced. With the continuous release of
fluid from the source, the current grew in width and depth until
it became unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances. The
wavelength and phase velocities of the disturbances were
consistent with a model of baroclinic instability of two-layer
flow when frictional dissipation due to Ekman layers is
included. However, when the current only occupied a small
fraction of the total depth, barotropic processes were also
thought to be important, with the growing waves gaining energy
from the horizontal shear. In other experiments, gravity
currents were produced by a point source adjacent to either a
zonal (circular) or a meridional (radial) vertical boundary. The
currents were also observed to become unstable to the same
upstream breaking waves as those on the continuous zonal

abstract = {Destructive macroalgal mass blooms threaten estuarine and coastal ecosystems worldwide. We asked which factors regulate macroalgal bloom intensity, distribution and species composition. In field experiments in the Baltic Sea, we analyzed the relative effects of nutrients, herbivores and algal propagule banks on population development and dominance patterns in two co-occurring bloom-forming macroalgae, Enteromorpha intestinalis and Pilayella littoralis. Both species were highly affected by the combined effects of a propagule bank, herbivory and nutrients. The magnitude of effects varied with season. The propagule bank was an important overwintering mechanism for both algae, and allowed for recruitment two months earlier than recruitment via freshly dispersed propagules. This provided a seasonal escape from intense herbivory and nutrient limitation later in the year. Favored by massive recruitment from the propagule bank, Enteromorpha was the superior space occupier in early spring, thereby reducing recruitment of Pilayella. Elimination of the propagule bank and recruitment via freshly dispersed propagules favored Pilayella. Strong and selective herbivory on Enteromorpha supported Pilayella in the presence, but not in the absence of the propagule bank. Nutrient enrichment in summer counteracted herbivore pressure on Enteromorpha, thereby negatively affecting Pilayella. Herbivore and nutrient effects were more pronounced for early life stages than adult algae. These results show that recruitment processes and forces affecting early life stages at the beginning of the vegetation period determine development and dominance patterns of macroalgal blooms. Herbivores naturally suppress blooms but increasing nutrient enrichment can override this important control mechanism. The propagule bank plays a previously unrecognized role for population and community dynamics.},

regional variations in the rate of SST change. The rapid warming

China Sea) and also over the Newfoundland–Labrador Shelf. The
Indian Ocean LMEs' warming was slow, while two major upwelling
areas – California and Humboldt Currents – experienced a slight
cooling. The Subarctic Gyre warming was likely caused by natural
variability related to the North Atlantic Oscillation. The
extremely rapid surface warming in the enclosed and
semi-enclosed European and East Asian Seas surrounded by major
industrial/population agglomerations may have resulted from the
observed terrestrial warming directly affecting the adjacent
coastal seas. Regions of freshwater influence in the European

abstract = {Availability of floating seaweeds may depend on the seasonal
cycles of benthic populations, but our ability to predict
temporal patterns of stranded biomasses is still limited.
Season-dependent, local storms favor detachment of seaweeds from
the substratum, which can be reflected in the stranded biomasses
on adjacent beaches after these events. Hence, we hypothesized
that seaweed strandings are positively correlated with storm
intensity. Using as a model the southern bull kelp Durvillaea
antarctica (Chamisso) Hariot, a species frequently found in
seaweed strandings in Chile, bimonthly surveys were carried out
on three beaches: Pichicuy (32° S), Itata Norte (36° S), and
Curi{\~{n}}anco (39° S) for 3 years (2014 to 2017). Stranded biomass,
total length, and wet weight of specimens were quantified and
related to local storms (using the Douglas sea scale). Stranded
biomasses decreased in the spring months of each year, being
higher in Pichicuy and Curi{\~{n}}anco than Itata Norte. Regression
models showed a better fit with recent storms in Curi{\~{n}}anco
compared to other beaches. An interannual decrease of beach-cast
raft size was observed, showing smaller specimens in Itata Norte
than those in Pichicuy and Curi{\~{n}}anco. Reduced habitat
availability and the exploitation of natural beds in the central
zone (34°–37° S) might explain the decrease of biomasses and
sizes of stranded bull kelps. Also, oceanographic features at
intermediate (i.e., local winds and currents) and large scales
(i.e., El Ni{\~{n}}o) can help to explain the temporal variability,
particularly in spring and summer. Our results suggest that
harvesting of stranded bull kelps might be most favorable in
summer and autumn.},

importance of marine and terrestrial sources of organic matter to
the food web of 4 nearshore reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel
(California, USA) over a 4 yr period that included substantial
variability in the availability of marine and terrestrial organic
matter. We measured stable C and N isotope values of ocean- and
land-derived sources of organic matter and of different types of
consumers on reefs that varied in exposure to freshwater runoff
and in biomass of giant kelp. d13C values of suspended
particulate organic matter (POM) on reefs tended to decrease
following periods of significant rainfall at the reef most
influenced by freshwater runoff, to increase with phytoplankton
standing crop at all reefs, and generally to decline in both wet
and dry years in late fall–early winter at all reefs. Stable
isotope values of reef consumers indicated little direct use of
terrestrially-derived POM. However, a pattern of 15N-enrichment
in 2 common benthic-feeding species, the sea urchin
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the annelid Diopatra ornata,
with increasing influence of runoff indicated that
terrestrially-derived nitrogen may enter the food web indirectly
through a trophic intermediate (e.g. microbes, algae). The
importance of giant kelp to the reef food web varied with
consumer feeding mode. In contrast to previous studies, d13C
values suggested little use of kelp-derived material by
suspension-feeders, based on the similarity in isotope values of
these consumers among reefs when kelp biomass was low, and the
absence of a directional shift in isotope values that would
indicate the use of more 13C-enriched kelp when kelp biomass was
higher at 2 of the reefs. However, isotope values for herbivores
were generally 13C-enriched relative to suspension-feeders,
reflecting the use of local giant kelp or other 13C-enriched
benthic algal production. Thus, spatial and temporal fluctuations
in the biomass of giant kelp would be least likely to impact the
food resources of suspension-feeders and have greatest effect on
benthic herbivores.},

and abiotic forces that can limit and punctuate the geographical
range and abundance of species through time. Determining the
relative strengths and nonlinear effects of these processes is
vital to understanding the biogeographical structures of species.
There has been an ongoing discussion concerning the relative
importance of these processes in controlling the dynamics of
giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, an important structure-forming
species on shallow reefs in the eastern Pacific. We used novel
spatial time-series that span nearly three decades to determine
the dominant drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass and the
temporal and spatial scales over which they operate across the
dominant range of the giant kelp in North America. Location
Near-shore areas from A{\~{n}}o Nuevo, California, to the USA/Mexico
border. Methods We employed empirical orthogonal functions to
elucidate the primary drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass across
space and time and then fit generalized additive and linear
models to determine the nonlinear effect and relative importance
of each of these potential drivers along the c. 1500-km study
region over a 25-year period. Results Wave disturbance, nitrate
availability and the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation
were the most important environmental predictors of giant kelp
canopy biomass, explaining 24.5{\%}, 12.7{\%} and 6.1{\%} of the
variance, respectively. Environmental drivers of canopy biomass
exhibited profound spatial differences in relative effect sizes.
Nonlinear effect shapes of each potential biomass driver were
determined, which explained these spatial differences. Main
conclusions These large-scale analyses help to reconcile the
local-scale conclusions of canopy biomass dynamics across the
California coastline and show that these dynamics differ
predictably in space and time in accordance with local and
regional differences in environmental drivers. By characterizing
the nonlinear effects of these drivers, we identified
spatio-temporal patterns of processes that cannot be detected by
remote sensing.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Are local ecological communities ever saturated with
species? That is, do they ever reach a point where species from
the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because
of exclusion by resident species? 2. We review the theoretical
evidence for saturation in various community models and find that
non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as
expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict
saturation. 3. Instead, models where coexistence is based on
niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where
coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed
predictions. 4. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a
necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in
ecological time. 5. We then argue that unsaturated (Type I)
assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even
saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to
richness over evolutionary time-scales. 6. If local richness is
not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local
constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in
turn, limit local rich- ness) become important, including
phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. 7.
Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction
of control for species richness is from regional to local. If
correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic
biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making
community ecology a more historical science.},

abstract = {There are at least 500 species of sharks inhabiting the world's
oceans and very little is known about the reproductive biology of
most of these species. By observing Scyliorhinids, which exhibit
oviparous reproductive behaviour, we can further understand the
nature of elasmobranch reproductive behaviour, including embryo
growth and development. Two Scyliorhinid species endemic to South
African waters are investigated here, Poroderma pantherinum,
commonly known as the Leopard catshark and Haploblepharus pictus
the Dark shyshark. Observations were made both in the field and
in the laboratory to ascertain differences in reproductive
behaviour. In the field P. pantherinumlaid their eggs at an
average depth of 15.7 m ±28.8 and their preferred choice of
substratum, onto which their eggs were singly attached, were
seafans. H. pictus,on the other hand, laid their eggs at an
average depth of 3.9 m ±15.9 and their preferred choice of
substratum, onto which they attach their eggs predominantly in
pairs, was the seaweed Bifurcariopis capensis.The average
temperature at which the eggs were found were similar for both
species (15°C) and eggs were observed to have been laid all year
round. Observations of embryo development were made in the
laboratory under different sets of controlled environmental
conditions. The two temperatures to which the eggs were exposed
were 14°C and 17°C and the condition of the water was either
turbulent or still. Embryo length-age relationships were linear
for both species. There was no significant difference in growth
rate under turbulent or still conditions. There was, however, a
significant difference in growth rate between embryos exposed to
different temperatures. For P. pantherinumthe average growth rate
in 14°C turbulent conditions was 0.048 cm/day ± 0.0001 and 0.05
cm/day ±0.0002 in 14°C still conditions. In 17°C inturbulent
conditions it was 0.06 cm/day ±0.0005 and 0.07 cm/day ±0.0001 in
17°still conditions. The average incubation period for P.
pantherinumwas recorded to be 39 weeks ±1.5 at 14 °C and 25 weeks
at 17°C. The embryo grew 1.4 times faster in a temperature raised
by 3°C. For H. University of Cape Town vii pictus,the average
growth rate in 14°C turbulent conditions was 0.04 cm/day ±0.0003
and 0.05 cm/day ±0.0001 in 14°C still conditions. In 17°C
turbulent conditions, the average growth rate was 0.09 cm/day
±0.001 and 0.07 cm/day ±0.001 in 17°C still conditions. The
incubation period was recorded to be 30.7 weeks ±7.25 at a
temperature of 14°C and 27.5 ± 1.9 at a temperature of 17°C. The
embryo grew 1.8 times faster in a temperature raised by 3°C. The
morphological changes taking place at different stages during
development were recorded, including appearance of external gill
filaments, opening of hatching slits, development of mouth and
gills and absorption of external gill filaments. The change in
yolk weight versus body weight was also calculated at different
stages of development. The results indicate that an increase in
body mass is directly proportional to a decrease in yolk mass.
Development in the laboratory was also compared to that in the
field. The results showed no difference in development of embryos
exposed to a temperature of 14°C as to those in the field.
Temperature recordings reveal that there were greater
fluctuations in temperature, where P. pantherinumegg cases were
found at {\textgreater}10 m as opposed to shallow waters, where H. pictuseggs
were found. To determine whether P. pantherinumand H. pictusegg
cases possess anti-fouling properties, live eggs, empty eggs and
plastic panels were placed in the ocean at the depths at which
eggs were naturally laid. The replicates were then harvested at
intervals of three, five and seven months and the percent fouling
cover on the different egg cases were compared. There was no
significant difference in percentage cover of species between the
different egg cases, however, there was a significant difference
in percentage cover over time i.e. the longer the eggs were
exposed to environmental conditions in the ocean, the more growth
was observed on the egg cases. Different species colonized the
egg cases, according to the depths at which they were placed.
This indicates that light and temperature influence the
settlement of different epibionts and there is some evidence
suggesting that University of Cape Town viii the embryo/egg case

abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for
conservation and climate change management, continuous and
progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting
species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated
in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and
the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to
Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models
(GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed
for their possible application to species modelling. A review of
recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely
explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species
responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often
skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies
fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line
relationships are often fitted without justification. Data
resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the
environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of
differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical
processes models could improve the selection of predictor
variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting
variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult.
Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological
realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial
data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships
between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data
is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new
methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and
a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the
minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing
conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with
curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression
(GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological
processes requires further evaluation before being used.
Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be
incorporated into species response models used in conservation.
For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a
routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory
used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the
statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated.
New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility
with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent
work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological
knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the
precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a
synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their
differing ecological insights not their methodology. Crown

abstract = {Regular observations made over a period of 5 yr in four permanent
transects provided data on plant, sea urchin, and fish densities
which indicate that two unusually severe winter storms in t980
(``Storm I'') and 1983 (``Storm It'') had different effects on a
southern California kelp-forest community. Storm I removed all
canopies of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, but spared most
understory kelps, mainly Pterygophora californica. Hence, the
previously large accumulation of detached drift kelp, mostly M.
pyrifera, disappeared. Denied their preferred diet of drift kelp,
the sea urchins Strongylocentrotusfranciscanus and S.purpuratus
then emerged from shelters to find alternative food. Without
effective predators, they con- sumed most living plants,
including the surviving under- story kelps. This weakened the
important detritus-based food chain, as indicated indirectly by
declining abundances of algal turf and fish (Embiotocidae) that
eat small animals living in turf. In 1983, Storm II reversed the
process by eliminating exposed urchins, while clearing rock
surfaces for widespread kelp settlement and growth. By summer
1984, the kelp grew to maturity to form extensive canopies
despite elevated water temperatures during summer and fall of
1983. Thus, severe storms may have vastly different effects on
community structure, depending on the state of the community
before the disturbance. Introduction},

abstract = {Overfishing and human-induced climate change are putting severe pressure on marine ecosystems. In the southern Benguela, most of South Africa's commercial fisheries have a long history of exploitation and this, coupled with spatio-temporal changes in key species over the last three decades has severely impacted some of South Africa's fisheries and ecosystems. This review summarizes these spatio-temporal changes and investigates possible drivers thereof. It incorporates both past and current research, with a large portion of the latter having formed part of the University of Cape Town's Ma-Re BASICS (Marine Research in the Benguela and Agulhas Systems for supporting Interdisciplinary Climate-change Science) 2010-2013 program. Almost all described changes involve a temporal decline or a spatial shift in species. Fishing seems to have played a role in many of the observed stock declines, for example through geographically disproportionate catches in relation to stock distribution. In some cases, changes in the physical environment seem to have played an additional role, e.g., rock lobsters on the west coast have been affected by fishing as well as changes in the physical environment. In almost all cases these changes have taken place since the 1980s/1990s, except for one or two resources, which have experienced declines since at least the mid 20th century. Spatial shifts in species have either involved an eastward expansion of cool-water species, including kelps, rock lobster and pelagic fish, or a retraction of warm-water species such as the brown mussel, suggesting a cooling of inshore waters along the south-west coast since the 1980s. This suggested cooling is revealed in ocean temperature (SST Pathfinder), wind and upwelling data for the Cape Peninsula and south-west coast region during the same period. The absence or inconsistency of long-term data is problematic when trying to identify drivers of ecosystem change, and actual ecosystem change itself. We discuss this using ocean temperature in the southern Benguela as an example. In addition, the complex interplay between climate and anthropogenic (notably fishing) drivers makes identification of drivers difficult and disentangling these combined effects will require interdisciplinary collaboration, co-ordinated ecosystem projects, increased modelling effort and the continuation, but also establishment, of new, long-term monitoring studies.},

abstract = {Clusters of range boundaries in coastal marine species often occur at shoreline locations where major nearshore ocean currents collide. Observing that these currents are typically composed of waters with quite different physical characteristics, biologists have traditionally assumed that high local densities of marine range limits result primarily from the strong water property gradients (particularly in temperature) that arise at oceanographic discontinuities. However, this view may overlook the potential for ocean flows themselves to generate distributional pattern. Here we explore this possibility in more detail using an extension of a coupled population dispersal model developed previously for benthic marine species with dispersing larvae. Results suggest that simple, common flow fields often observed in association with biogeographic boundaries worldwide may have the potential to constrain a species' geographic range, even when suitable habitat outside that range is abundant. Model predictions suggest that these boundaries can function as one- or two-way barriers to range expansion and may be differentially permeable, with boundary leakiness depending on life-history characteristics and the degree of temporal variability in the nearshore flow field.},

affect recruitment, growth and survival of understorey species

one of several species of large brown algae inhabiting the low
intertidal zone. Effects of its canopy and its associated
understorey coralline algae on community development were tested
at 2 sites (Moeraki and Kaikoura) at different times of year
between February 1999 and October 2001. Removal of D, antarctica
canopies had surprising results compared to most studies where
canopies of large brown algae were removed. The greatest initial
recruitment of bull kelp occurred beneath intact canopies,
usually in areas where corallines were removed. Recruitment was
highly variable through time, with peaks occurring in June and
October (austral winter-spring), depending mostly on when
canopies were removed. There was an order of magnitude difference
in recruitment between sites. The cover of turfing coralline
algae, however, increased in all canopy removal treatments. A
major source of mortality of young recruits was grazing by the
herbivorous fish Odax pullus. Its distinct grazing marks were
seen on recruits, almost exclusively outside the canopy of bull
kelp where 80{\%} of recruits were grazed. We show that D.
antarctica has the ability to recruit beneath adult canopies, but
that survival and growth ultimately depend on the extent of
canopies, underlaying benthic algae and escapes from grazing by
herbivorous fish.},

large-scale animal distribution patterns are driven by food
availability, not the absence of predators. At regional scales
however, it is likely that current predation or past predation
events have shaped local distributions, at least in marine birds
and pinnipeds. Wasp-waist control occurs when one of the
intermediate trophic levels is dominated by a single species, as
occurs with small pelagic fishes of the world's up-welling zones.

abstract = {Marine reserves are the primary management tool for Guam's reef fish fishery. While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.},

water velocities of 10 to 20 m/s and accompanying accelerations

area and volume respectively, the bigger an individual is, the
larger the forces on it become. This size-force relationship
suggests that large intertidal algae must be particularly well
designed if they are to survive. The feather boa kelp, Egregiu
menziesii (Turner), grows to a size that is unusually large for
its wave-exposed habitat, leading us to inquire into the
mechanisms that allow it to attain this stature. A
hydro-mechanical computer model is used to predict the magnitude
of the forces on E. menziesii in various wave conditions and for
various plant sizes. Based on measurements of the strength of E.
menziesii, an intact, average-sized plant's survivorship in the

However, entanglement with other plants and damage from herbivory

Genetic structure and diversity were inferred using seven
microsatel- lite loci, for 27 sites throughout the entire
distributional range. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) was
performed with and without information about genetic structure
(sub-taxon niche structure) to predict distributions for the Last
Glacial Maximum (LGM), the warmer Mid-Holocene (MH) and the
present. Both ENM approaches predicted a wider potential
distribution in dee- per waters than is presently known, a
post-glacial expansion to northern shores and the extirpation of
southern edges during the warmer MH. Genetic data corroborated
range dynamics, revealing three major genetic groups with cur-
rent boundaries in the Bay of Biscay and the Lisbon coastal
region, pinpointing ancient refugial origins. Despite extensive
southern range contraction, the southernmost warmer regions are
still the richest in genetic diversity, indicating long-term
persistence of large populations. ENMs suggested that this could
only have been possible due to stable refugia in deeper reefs.
The global distribution of gene pools of temperate marine forests
is explained by past range shifts that structured both
latitudinal glacial refugia and depth refugia during warmer
periods. Deep rear edge populations play a fundamental role
during periods of extreme climate, allowing persistence and
retaining some of the largest genetic diversity pools of the
species' distri- bution.},

abstract = {In almost any Atlantic coastal area of Europe where there is a suitable substratum and adequate water quality, one or more species of kelp may be found. Their high productivity and complex biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities, particularly when present in dense stands known as "kelp forests". Currently, these species are subject to important novel constraints of physical and anthropogenic origins that can strongly modify their sustainability, their distribution and the biodiversity of associated species. Along the Portuguese coastline there is a perception by the local and scientific communities that some kelp species abundance is declining, particularly at the southern coast. Nevertheless, no large-scale spatial study of kelp abundance and diversity has been done. With the acronym Findkelp, this study aimed to assess from May to August 2008, the Portuguese kelp conservation status through community participation, field-based observations and large-scale Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. A communication strategy towards scuba divers and other coastal zone users was made to build and educate a team of informed volunteers that worked as independent observers, reporting georeferenced data in an electronic data-base available on the project's website. At randomly underwater chosen locations (n=56) from the volunteers reported sites (n=388), structural descriptors of kelp populations were groundtruthed, by means of non-destructive sampling techniques (3x50m belt-transects). By crossing the volunteer's reported data with the groundtruthed data, using error matrices and Kappa statistics with concordance agreement scales, a Portuguese coast line GIS map with perfect agreement (K=0.827) was made including the current distribution, diversity and conservation status of 6 kelp species.},

One large-scale event has been reported where kelp forests along the Norwegian and Russian coast were grazed by sea urchins during the early 1970s. The barren ground area has persisted since. Different theories to explain the grazing event have been presented. This paper seeks to sort and summarize earlier published papers and national reports and to critically examine the most important theories presented to explain the grazing event. The conclusion is that the reason for the event is unknown and it is too late to find causes 40 years after it took place. However, new data and new geographical analysis tools provide insight into the extent and consequences of this dramatic event, and show re-vegetation of kelp forests in the southernmost area. Emphasis in future studies should be given to understand the reasons for shifts between the two ecosystem states and take advantage of the ongoing shift. Such basic ecological knowledge could provide an important basis for better understanding the system and further, to understand the extent to which other observed large- scale changes (e.g. climatic changes, fish stock reductions) affect kelp forestsea urchin interaction.},

abstract = {Pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry allows instantaneous estimates of photosynthetic rates, but may well produce variable measurements of photosynthetic activity depending on time of day, recent light history, internal fluctuations, and environmental variability. To investigate this, we compare estimates of diurnal variability in relative photosynthetic performance for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh, obtained from PAM fluorometry at three depths during 3 days characterized by different light conditions, and for two different blade ages. Sampling in the mid morning, late morning, early afternoon and late afternoon, we examined diurnal changes in relative photosynthetic performance in meristematic tissue and older blades occurring near the bottom, in the mid water, and at the water surface. Measures of maximum relative electron transport rates (rETRmax), minimum saturating irradiance (Ek), photosynthetic efficiency ($\alpha$) and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) show that giant kelp blades in the mid water and near the bottom exhibit little to no photosynthetic changes during the day. Near the surface, however, blades exhibit photosynthetic characteristics similar to light-adapted species in that they begin the day acclimated to low light, acclimate to increasing irradiance during the day, and end the day acclimated to low light. Consequently, while estimates of rETRmaxwere highest during the midday for all sample depths and days, they were also always highest near the surface for both old blades (112.16 ± 8.7, 98.6 ± 14.7, 70.16 ± 5.7) and meristematic tissue (109.0 ± 9.0, 86.9 ± 1.9, 59.2 ± 11.6, surface, mid water and bottom, respectively). Similar patterns were observed for Ekfor both old blades (169.2 ± 5.4, 88.0 ± 11.2, 83.8 ± 5.2) and meristematic tissue (138.4 ± 11.5, 96.6 ± 4.69, 68.4 ± 10.6). In contrast, estimates of Fv/Fmwere lowest near the surface during the midday for both old blades (0.6 ± 0.02, 0.73 ± 0.69, 0.75 ± 0.01) and meristematic tissue (0.58 ± 0.02, 0.69 ± 0.05, 0.74 ± 0.01, surface, mid water and bottom, respectively). These patterns coincided with similar patterns in ambient light, which was most variable and reached its greatest values near the surface during the midday. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A series of local factors such as substrate structure, presence or absence of kelp forests and environmental variables play an important role in determining both the diversity and abundance of temperate reef fish assemblages. The presence of kelp forests has been shown to increase struc- tural complexity, available shelter, and prey availability in the reef environment. This, in turn, may affect the structural organization of the fish assemblage. In this study, the diversity, abundance and trophic patterns of subtidal fish assemblages at 2 localities off the northern Chilean coast were ana- lyzed. These localities differ markedly in their spatial structure: the subtidal substratum at Caleta Err{\'{a}}zuriz is characterized by a sloping bedrock with large rocks and boulders and a kelp forest, while at Carrizal Bajo it consists of a sharply declining bedrock with few boulders and isolated kelp stands. We hypothesized that structurally highly complex habitats would exhibit higher diversity, abundance and a more complex trophic organization in terms of more functional groups and guilds of reef fish assemblages than less structured environments. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found similar species diversity and fish abundance at both localities. However, there were clear differences in species dom- inance, number of functional groups and trophic guilds. There were also marked differences in the trophic webs between localities. In the presence of kelp forest, both carnivores and omnivores con- sumed mainly benthic prey inhabiting the understory canopy, while in its absence carnivores fed on pelagic prey in the water column. Therefore, a more complex spatial structure would seem to support a more complex trophic organization with a greater degree of connectivity, as well as interaction between the species in a reef fish assemblage.

abstract = {The potential of drifting Macrocystis pyrifera kelp for
transporting associated animals and plants long distances around
the southern oceans was assessed by anchoring kelp holdfasts off
the Tasmanian coast in 1985, monitoring the turnover of
organisms, and relating species survival to water-transport
times and species geographic distributions. Although most of the
common animal species and approximately half of the plant
species associated with Tasmanian M. pyrifera holdfasts were
still present on kelp holdfasts after 191 d at sea, very few of
these species have been recorded from New Zealand. It therefore
seems unlikely that M. pyrifera plants with intact holdfasts are
presently drifting to New Zealand. Drifting kelps probably
become negatively buoyant in the Tasman Sea because dissolved
nitrate concentrations are insufficient for normal plant growth.
Moreover, even if some kelp plants do drift to New Zealand it is
possible that their holdfasts rapidly disintegrate in the open
ocean because of the abundance of the boring isopods
Phycolimnoria spp. in Tasmanian holdfasts. In contrast to the
restricted distributions of Tasmanian holdfast-inhabiting
species, most of the identified species collected from M.
pyrifera holdfasts at subantarctic Macquarie Island also
occurred 5 000 km west at Kerguelen Island. Because of the
extensive ranges of many subantarctic species, the good
probability of survival of epifaunal species on drifting kelps,
and the high surface-water nitrate concentrations and low
holdfast-densities of Phycolimnoria spp. in the higher
latitudes, it is likely that M. pyrifera-mediated transport of
faunal and floral propagules has recently occurred, and is
probably presently occurring, in subantarctic waters.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems
in the world. Accurately quantifying net primary productivity
(NPP) of kelps is challenging, as the carbon being produced is
continually being lost through erosion of tissue and as dissolved
organic carbon. Here, we use a physiological model that
incorporates in situ estimates of photosynthesis vs. irradiance
(P-E) parameters, biomass and underwater irradiance to estimate
NPP of a subsurface Ecklonia radiata kelp forest in northern New
Zealand over the seasonal cycle and depth range. Model testing
found that predicted gross primary production (GPP) based on
seasonal and depth-specific P-E parameters, biomass and
underwater irradiance levels was strongly related to rates of GPP
measured on individual kelp in the field (r2 = 0.83). Sensitivity
analysis indicated that NPP estimates were most sensitive to
variation in biomass and photosynthetic parameters. Using this
approach, estimated annual production (±SE) at 6 m (615 ± 183 g C
m−2 yr−1) was found to be 1.6× greater than at 14 m depth (374 ±
102 g C m−2 yr−1), which was proportional to the difference in
biomass between depths. This indicates that the greater
photosynthetic abilities (higher maximum photosynthetic rates and
photosynthetic efficiency) of deeper kelp offset the effects of
reduced irradiance on overall NPP at depth. This study
demonstrates how in situ P-E curves of adult kelp can be
incorporated with biomass and irradiance data to estimate NPP of
kelp forests, and highlights the importance of understanding
depth-related variation in photosynthetic performance when
estimating primary production of subsurface kelp forests.},

Observer speed had a cntical though differential effect upon sample counts. Small or cryptic fishes were severely underesti- mated at relatively fast observer speeds because not enough time was available to search thoroughly for them. Some highly mobile species, however, were overestimated at slow speeds, due to their movement across the transect during counting penods, or to inadvertent double counting. Rotenone samples confirmed that, regardless of observer speed, highly cryptic species are largely overlooked by visual census It is suggested that observer speed should be standardzed in survey designs. Other suggestions for improving precision and accuracy of visual surveys are discussed. INTRODUCTION},

We examined morphological plasticity of this species in response to temperature by growing fronds at 5 and 20 °C, temperatures representative of winter and summer surface seawater in the Gulf of Maine. As expected, C. crispus had higher growth rates at the higher temperature when growth rate was measured in terms of length, biomass, surface area, dichotomy and branch production. The higher growth rate of fronds at 20 °C was associated with a distribution of accumulated biomass into more surface area/unit biomass and more branches/unit length or biomass. These differences resulted in the growth of morphologically more complex thalli at the higher temperature, as measured by significantly higher fractal dimension and ratio of perimeter to square root of the surface area of thalli grown at 20 °C compared to those grown at 5 °C. The morphological distribution of new tissue has implications for the uptake and exchange of nutrients and light harvesting such that plants grown at 20 °C would have more efficient exchanges due to (1) a larger ratio of interface with the bulk media (surface area)/metabolically active biomass and (2) more turbulent mixing and increased convective heat transfer at the thallus surface due to the increased thallus complexity.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton seed populations of newly upwelled water collected
off the Cape Peninsula in the southern Benguela upwelling system
were examined. The similar composition of the phytoplankton
along the entire base of the plume implies a common source of
water during each individual upwelling event. Greater
variability in the composition and abundance of phytoplankton of
different upwelling events was attributed to varying offshore
phytoplankton developmental processes, the success of the
seeding strategies of various species and variation in
circulation patterns. Such variability was found to be
instrumental in determining the species composition and the time
required for bloom development. The prevalence of intact diatom
resting spores, especially of the genus Chaetoceros, in newly
upwelled waters demonstrated the ability of spores to utilize
the mixing and current patterns in order to seed upwelling
systems. Higher sinking rates would appear to be the key
advantage to spore formation, rapidly removing the population
from an inhospitable environment following nutrient depletion,
thus preventing offshore advection and maintaining the
population close to the centre of upwelling. The germination of
diatom resting spores following incubation of newly upwelled
water provided convincing evidence of the initiation of diatom
blooms by resting spores in upwelling systems. These resting
stages are therefore of selective advantage in seeding upwelling
systems, increasing the chances of a species being represented
when conditions are favourable for growth. Thus spore-forming
diatom species have been found to be among the most abundant and
persistent phytoplankton species in the southern Benguela.},

Where surf zones are reasonably broad and shallow, cellular circulation patterns predominate and these tend to retain nutrients generated by the macrofauna and interstitial fauna of the beach. These nutrients may then cause blooms of surf zone phytoplankton which in turn serve as food for macrofauna filter feeders.

abstract = {Hudson Bay is a large, estuarine, shelf-like sea at the southern margin of the Arctic, where changes in seasonal ice cover and river discharge appear already to be underway. Here we present lignin data for dated sediments from eleven box cores and evaluate sources of terrigenous carbon, transport pathways, and whether terrigenous organic matter has been influenced by recent environmental change. Lignin yields (0.04 to 1.46 mg/100 mg organic carbon) decreased from the margin to the interior and from south to north, broadly reflecting the distribution of river inputs. Lignin compositional patterns indicated distinct regional sources with boreal forest (woody gymnosperm) vegetation an important source in the south, vs. tundra (non-woody angiosperm) in the north. Lignin patterns suggest redistribution of a fine-grained, mineral-associated fraction of the southern-derived terrigenous carbon to the northeast part of the Bay and ultimately into west Hudson Strait with the Bay's cyclonic coastal circulation. A small component of the carbon makes it to the central basins of Hudson Bay but most of the terrigenous organic material in that area appears to derive from resuspension of older, isostatically-rebounding coastal and inner shelf deposits. Most modern plant debris appears to be retained near river mouths due to hydrodynamic sorting, with the exception of the southwest inner shelf, where these materials extend {\textgreater} 30 km from shore. Temporal changes in the composition of terrigenous organic carbon recorded in most of the southern Hudson Bay cores perhaps reflect increases in erosion and cross-shelf transport from coastal deposits, possibly mediated by change in ice climate. In contrast, temporal changes in the northwest may relate to changes in the supply of modern plant debris under recent warmer conditions. On the western shelf, changes may relate to ice climate and the distribution of northern coastal water and/or changes in the delivery of materials by the Churchill River due to water diversion. Although the cores show evidence of change related to the ice climate, there is little evidence that ice itself transports terrigenous organic carbon within the system. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This thesis deals with physical factors and biological
interactions affecting the distribution of two fucoid species,
Fucus vesiculosus and F. serratus, in the Baltic Sea, N. Europe.
Studies have been carried out in two quite different
environments: an archipelago, and an open rocky coast. The
archipelago has an extremely long coastline with a heterogeneous
submerged landscape of different substrate types, slopes, water
qualities, and degrees of wave exposure. The factors influencing
F. vesiculosus distribution, morphology and epiphyte composition
were studied in the Stockholm archipelago using field surveys and
spatial modelling in Geographic information systems (GIS). A
GIS-method to estimate wave exposure was developed and validated
by comparing the result to an index based on vertical zonation of
lichens. Wave exposure was considered an important factor for
predicting the distribution of F. vesiculosus by its ability to
clean hard surfaces from silt, and a predictive model was
constructed based on the information of wave exposure and slope
of the shore. It is suggested that the lower distribution
boundary of attached F. vesiculosus is set by sediment in
sheltered parts of the archipelago, and by light availability in
highly wave exposed parts. The morphology of F. vesiculosus was
studied over a wave exposure gradient, and several characters
responded in accordance with earlier studies. However, when
separating effects of wave exposure from effects of other
confounding water property parameters, only thallus width was
significantly different. Several water property parameters were
shown to be correlated with wave exposure in the Stockholm
archipelago, and the mechanism responsible for the effects on F.
vesiculosus morphology is discussed. The composition of epiphytes
on F. vesiculosus varied over a wave exposure gradient with a
positive correlation to Elachista fucicola, and a negative to
Chorda filum. At an open coast the physical environment is much
less heterogeneous compared to an archipelago. The distributions
of F. vesiculosus, F. serratus, turf-forming algae, and the
seafloor substrate, were surveyed along the open coasts of Oeland
and Gotland. Turf-forming algae dominated all hard substrates in
the area, and Polysiphonia fucoides was most abundant. At the
Gotland coast F. vesiculosus was less abundant than at the Oeland
coast, and F. serratus occurred only in the southernmost part.
Fucus serratus was increasingly more common towards south which
was interpreted as an effect mainly of the Baltic salinity
gradient, or the variation of salinity that has occurred in the
past. The effects of turf-forming algae and sediment on F.
serratus recruitment at 7 m depth off the Oeland east coast were
studied in the field, and by laboratory experiments. Almost no
recruits were found in the algal turf outside the F. serratus
patches. More fine sediment was found in the turf than in the F.
serratus patches, suggesting that the turf accumulates sediment
by decreasing resuspension. Both filamentous algae and sediment
decreased the attachment ability of F. serratus zygotes and
survival of recruits, and sediment had the strongest effect. It
is therefore suggested that F. serratus has difficulties
recruiting outside its patches, and that these difficulties are
enforced by the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea, which has
favoured growth of filamentous algae and increased sedimentation.
An overall conclusion is that Fucus distribution is affected by
large-scale-factors, such as the eutrophication and salinity
changes of the Baltic Sea, as well as by small-scale variation in
wave exposure, substrate and slope, and by surface competition
with neighbouring species.},

isolated seamount rises 3000 m in a current field flowing from

paper presents an analysis of the larval dispersal modes of the

species with either a short-lived or no planktonic larval phase.
The preponderance of such larval strategies and the observation
of abundant drifting kelp near the seamount suggest that rafting
of adults may be an effective dispersal mode. The presence of a
recirculating flow in the form of a modified Taylor cap appears
important for trapping short-lived larvae on the seamount.
However, because the water mass is replaced about every 17 days,
medium and long-lived larvae would not be retained. The
interplay between local currents, available dispersal vectors,
and life-history strategies cannot be overlooked in the

Correlations between these factors indicate that as fronds age

overall buoyancy of the frond increases. Measurement of drag

abstract = {Many aspects of morphology of benthic algae (length, surface
area-to-volume ratio, and blade undulation) are plastic traits
that vary in response to physical factors (such as light or
water flow environment). This study examines whether frond
buoyancy is a plastic trait, and whether differences in
morphology including buoyancy affect the potential persistence
of macroalgae in habitats characterized by different water flow
regimes. Fronds of the tropical alga Turbinaria ornata in
protected backreef environments in Moorea, French Polynesia
possess pneumatocysts (gas-filled floats) and experience
positive buoyant forces, whereas fronds in wave-exposed forereef
sites either lack pneumatocysts entirely or have very small,
rudimentary pneumatocysts and experience negative buoyant
forces. Forereef fronds transplanted to the backreef developed
pneumatocysts and experienced increased buoyant force indicating
that buoyancy is a phenotypically plastic trait in T. ornata. In
comparing the potential for dislodgement by drag, drag was
greater on forereef fronds at low flow speeds as these fronds
were stiffer and did not bend over at low flow speeds and
therefore were less streamlined in the flow than backreef algae,
which bent easily. The environmental stress factor (ESF) (a
measure of the likelihood of detachment for a frond in its
habitat) was higher for forereef than backreef fronds at all
flow speeds. When examined with respect to the flow velocities
likely in their respective habitats however, the chance of
detachment for backreef and forereef was similar. Neither
backreef nor forereef fronds were predicted to break under
normal, non-storm conditions, but both were predicted to break
in storms. Strong forereef morphologies are well suited to
habitats characterized by rapid flow, whereas the weaker,
buoyant, tall backreef fronds are well suited to habitats where
crowding and shading is common but hydrodynamic forces are low.},

This paper presents a method for estimating seagrass dry weight using a photo-library of classes of differing seagrass biomass. Field data were collected at seagrass beds in Ngederrak Reef, Palau, in 2006. Photos of 25 × 25 cm quadrats were taken prior to the collection the above-ground biomass for determination of biomass dry weight. Fifteen classes of seagrass biomass and substrate type were identified. The dry weight for each class of seagrass was measured in laboratory. A photo-library was created for biomass classification where each in situ quadrat photo is accompanied with seagrass dry weight of the sample and a photo of the sorted sample taken in laboratory. The photo-library of quadrats was then used to estimate seagrass biomass on photos gathered along 100 m long transects at 2 m intervals. This procedure was conducted by three different observers. The seagrass dry weight estimates were consistent between interpreters even if one of the interpreters had no experience in seagrass research. This approach allows quick collection of seagrass dry weight data over large areas. The method can be used for creating seagrass biomass maps by snorkelling/diving and/or for calibrating and validating biomass maps created by remote sensing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

antagonistic interaction. Direct field observations of
interannual and among-site changes in abundance of low
intertidalmacrophytes also suggest a negative interaction.
Several years (2001–2006) of quantification of surf-zone
chlorophyll concentrations and light reaching the intertidal
benthos suggested that severe light attenuation fromdense
phytoplankton blooms is an important mechanism underlying this
inverse phytoplankton–macrophyte relationship. From early June to
September of 2004 we quantified the response of the intertidal
kelp Saccharina sessile to experimentally manipulated light
regimes that mimicked the attenuation during blooms. Shading
frames were installed in the low intertidal zone to manipulate
the light levels available to the benthos at two sites of
contrasting long-term differences in average phytoplankton
abundance. Treatments included shaded and unshaded plots that
were 0.25 m2 in area. Although the magnitude of the effect was
context-dependent, shading strongly decreased growth rates and
abundance of S. sessile. These results are comparable to results
in estuarine studies that have demonstrated adverse effects on
benthic macrophytes as a result of eutrophication and subsequent
light limitation and are the first demonstration of
phytoplankton-induced light limitation for energetic open coasts.
In these systemswhere annual benthic production can exceed the
pelagic production andwhere perennial macrophytes such as kelp
and surf grasses are important habitat modifiers, large-scale
reduction of macrophytes via phytoplankton shading could lead to
profound modifications of coastal ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {Introduction Surveys of the marine ichthyofauna associated with temperate reefs are challenging because, unlike soft sediment, these habitats cannot be surveyed with trawl gear (Sink et al. 2012). Reefs often harbour complex species assemblages, stratified according to physical and biological gradients (Ross {\&} Quattrini 2007; S{\"{o}}ffker, Sloman {\&} Hall-Spencer 2011). Survey methods for such habitats have mostly been confined to diver-based underwater visual census (UVC) for shallow depths ({\textless}30 m) (Assis et al. 2013) and traps, hooks and line fishing for deeper depths ({\textgreater}30 m) (S{\"{o}}ffker et al. 2011). Recently developed remote video-based methods have produced promising results (Cappo, Speare {\&} De'ath 2004; Stoner et al. 2008). Unlike stationary video sampling methods such as baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys (Cappo, Speare {\&} De'ath 2007), remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys, like diver-based UVC, allow for a comprehensive inspection of the sampling area and can also be used within a standardised sampling design in the form of transects or fixed, baited stationary deployments. Here we report on the first ROV dives to investigate the deep reef ichthyofauna and its associated habitats on the central Agulhas Bank. In addition to general habitat observations, we were interested in (1) fish behaviour towards a ROV, (2) deployment times sufficient to detect representative species assemblages and (3) the number of fish species detected relative to other surveys. Methods Study area The Agulhas Bank is the centre of abundance for a number of southern African warm temperate demersal reef species, many of which are endemic (Sink et al. 2012). Most of the hard substrate habitats of the Agulhas Bank remain poorly researched (G{\"{o}}tz et al. 2014; Smale et al. 1993). Background: Despite their ecological and economic importance, reef habitats on the central Agulhas Bank, off the southern tip of Africa, remain poorly studied. The ichthyofauna of these habitats cannot be surveyed using trawl gear.},

Here, we present seawater temperatures from southwestern Australia and describe, in detail, the marine climatology of Cockburn Sound, a large, multiple-use coastal embayment. We compared temperature and dissolved oxygen levels in 2011 with data from routine monitoring conducted from 2002–2010.

Ecological responses to short-term extreme events are poorly understood, but evidence from elsewhere along the Western Australian coastline suggests that the heat wave was associated with high rates of coral bleaching; fish, invertebrate and macroalgae mortalities; and algal blooms. However, there is a paucity of historical information on ecologically-sensitive habitats and taxa in Cockburn Sound, so that formal examinations of biological responses to the heat wave were not possible. The 2011 heat wave provided insights into conditions that may become more prevalent in Cockburn Sound, and elsewhere, if the intensity and frequency of short-term extreme events increases as predicted.},

distributions, with range limits often resulting from
environmental stressors exceeding organism tolerances. However,
these abiotic factors may differentially affect species with
multiple life-history stages. Between September 2004 and January
2006, the roles of temperature and nutrient availability in
explaining the southern distributions of two understory kelps,
Pterygophora californica and Eisenia arborea (Phaeophyceae,
Laminariales), were investigated along the coast of California,
USA and the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, by limiting
either: (a) tissue nitrogen uptake and storage by adult
sporophytes during periods of elevated temperature, and/or (b)
production of embryonic sporophytes by microscopic gametophytes.
Results suggest that while adult sporophytes of both species are
tolerant of high temperatures and low nutrients, reproduction by
their microscopic stages is not. Specifically, while E. arborea
produced embryonic sporophytes at both 12 and 18 degrees C,
temperatures commonly observed throughout the southern portion of
its range, P. californica produced sporophytes at 12 but not at
18 degrees C. As a result, it appears that the southern
distribution of P. californica, which ends in northern Baja
California, Mexico, may be limited by temperature acting on its
microscopic stages. In contrast, the ability of E. arborea's
microscopic and adult stages to tolerate elevated temperatures
allows it to persist in the warmer southern waters of Baja
California, as well as to the north along the California coast
where both species co-occur.},

abstract = {nvestigators working in both terrestrial and marine systems hypothesize that prey defenses are better developed in tropical than in temperate habitats because tropical consumers are more active and diverse. To investigate the hypothesis that chemical defenses are more potent in tropical than in temperate seaweeds, we conducted 38 feeding assays involving seven genera of algae. We offered tropical and temperate sea urchins the choice of a temperate alga from North Carolina or a closely related tropical alga from the Bahamas. Plants were freeze-dried, ground to a fine powder, embedded in agar, and presented in congeneric pairs (North Carolina species vs. Bahamian species), or same-species pairs, to the temperate urchin Arbacia punctulata and the tropical urchin Lytechinus variegatus. For the genera we tested (the red alga Amphiroa, the green alga Udotea, and the brown algae Dictyopteris, Dictyota, Lobophora, Padina, and Sargassum), we documented a general pattern in which the mean amount of North Carolina seaweeds eaten was approximately twice that of their Bahamian congeners. Dictyota was an exception to the overall pattern, in that mean consumption of temperate and tropical species was equivalent. In addition to showing a latitudinal difference in seaweed palatability, we found that some species ex- hibited significant, between-population variation in herbivore resistance on a local scale. The most notable example was Dictyota menstrualis from North Carolina. When collected from a shallow inshore site, this species was significantly more palatable than tropical species of Dictyota in four of six contrasts. When collected from a deeper offshore site, it was significantly less palatable than the tropical species in four of six contrasts. Thus, for this species, the between-population variance in palatability within a geographic region (North Carolina) bracketed the variance in palatability that we found among species and between regions. Feeding assays with both temperate and tropical urchins produced similar results, in- dicating that choices were made based on fundamental characteristics of the algae rather than on greater familiarity with local prey species. To see if chemical defenses could explain the differences in herbivore resistance that we noted using freeze-dried algae, we tested the effects of lipid-soluble and water-soluble extracts from each alga on urchin feeding by incorporating extracts into a standard palatable food. We also measured protein content and percent ash-free dry mass of the seaweeds in order to correlate urchin feeding preferences with these measures of food quality. Lipophilic chemical extracts explained urchin pref- erences in 9 of 15 (60{\%}) North Carolina-Bahamas contrasts. Water-soluble extracts, protein content, and percent ash-free dry mass generally did not account for feeding patterns seen in the original assays. Our results support the general hypothesis that tropical seaweeds have stronger chemical defenses than temperate seaweeds. For some genera, however, smaller-scale local variability in herbivore resistance within a species can be as striking as overall latitudinal differences},

The objective of this study was to independently validate a model of algal biomass productivity accounting for both light and temperature and constructed using parameters experimentally derived using short-term indoor experiments. To do this, the accuracy of a model developed for Chlorella vulgaris was assessed against data collected from photobioreactors operated outdoor (New Zealand) over different seasons, years, and operating conditions (temperature-control/no temperature-control, batch, and fed-batch regimes). The model accurately predicted experimental productivities under all conditions tested, yielding an overall accuracy of ±8.4{\%} over 148 days of cultivation. For the purpose of assessing the feasibility of full-scale algal cultivation, the use of the productivity model was therefore shown to markedly reduce uncertainty in cost of biofuel production while also eliminating uncertainties in water demand, a critical element of environmental impact assessments. Simulations at five climatic locations demonstrated that temperature-control in outdoor photobioreactors would require tremendous amounts of energy without considerable increase of algal biomass. Prior assessments neglecting the impact of temperature variations on algal productivity in photobioreactors may therefore be erroneous.},

abstract = {Deep-sea benthic ecosystems are sustained largely by organic
matter settling from the euphotic zone. These fluxes usually
have a more or less well-defined seasonal component, often with
two peaks, one in spring/early summer, the other later in the
year. Long time-series datasets suggest that inter-annual
variability in the intensity, timing and composition of flux
maxima is normal. The settling material may form a deposit of
``phytodetritus'' on the deep-seafloor. These deposits, which
are most common in temperate and high latitude regions,
particularly the North Atlantic, evoke a response by the benthic
biota. Much of our knowledge of these responses comes from a few
time-series programmes, which suggest that the nature of the
response varies in different oceanographic settings. In
particular, there are contrasts between seasonal processes in
oligotrophic, central oceanic areas and those along eutrophic
continental margins. In the former, it is mainly ``small
organisms'' (bacteria and protozoans) that respond to pulsed
inputs. Initial responses are biochemical (e.g. secretion of
bacterial exoenzymes) and any biomass increases are time lagged.
Increased metabolic activity of small organisms probably leads
to seasonal fluctuations in sediment community oxygen
consumption, reported mainly in the North Pacific. Metazoan
meiofauna are generally less responsive than protozoans
(foraminifera), although seasonal increases in abundance and
body size have been reported. Measurable population responses by
macrofauna and megafauna are less common and confined largely to
continental margins. In addition, seasonally synchronised
reproduction and larval settlement occur in some larger animals,
again mainly in continental margin settings. Although seasonal
benthic responses to pulsed food inputs are apparently
widespread on the ocean floor, they are not ubiquitous. Most
deep-sea species are not seasonal breeders and there are
probably large areas, particularly at abyssal depths, where
biological process rates are fairly uniform over time. As with
other aspects of deep-sea ecology, temporal processes cannot be
encapsulated by a single paradigm. Further long time-series
studies are needed to understand better the nature and extent of
seasonality in deep-sea benthic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Abstract. Genetic analyses of marine population structure often find only slight geographic differentiation in species with high dispersal potential. Interpreting the significance of this slight genetic signal has been difficult because even mild genetic structure implies very limited demographic exchange between populations, but slight differentiation could also be due to sampling error. Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2–5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25–150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well. $\backslash$nKey words: connectivity; dispersal; isolation by distance; larvae; population structure.},

Nitrate concentrations below 4.5-m depth usually exceeded 1 AM and were highest during spring upwelling, lowest during summer.

Translocation of nitrogenous com- pounds by the kelp plant from depths where concentrations are higher could compensate for this limitation. The summer die-off of the surface canopy may be caused by the in- ability of plants to translocate nutrients due to low availability of nutrients in the deeper water. The maximum change in dissolved oxygen measured was 0.43 mol 02 m2 between 0900 and 1130 PST; extrapolated to 1 day this yields a production of 1.0 mol 02 m2 d-' (9.5 g C m-2 d1).},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been depicted as a useful tool
for improving fishery management and protecting biodiversity. For
example, by acting as source populations, MPAs may provide a
spillover of adults/propagules, enhancing recruitment to
surrounding, non-protected waters. However, such positive effect
will depend on how a MPAs design matches population biology and
dispersal abilities of the target species. High levels of
intraspecific genetic diversity without pronounced structure have
been found in many marine organisms over large spatial scales
(from hundreds to thousands kilometres) but do not hold for other
ecologically and economically important species such as coral
reef fishes, seagrasses and kelps. In particular, the limited
potential for dispersal of many macroalgae suggests the
occurrence of self-sustaining, ``closed'' populations that
contrast with the ``open'' populations of many fishes and
invertebrates. Consequently, the high resilience of
fish/invertebrate populations cannot be generalized to the whole
marine realm. In the present work, we use genetic tools to
explore the role of the MPA Parc naturel marin d'Iroise in the
management of the emblematic kelp Laminaria digitata. While kelps
have received much more scientific attention than any other
seaweed group, there is still critical baseline knowledge which
needs to be addressed for their effective management. Our genetic
survey of 12 L. digitata populations along the Brittany coast,
four of them located within the boundaries of the Parc naturel
marin d'Iroise, allowed us to assess the conservation value of
these kelp populations. In particular, classical genetic metrics
as well as more recent clustering approaches were used to
identify and characterize Management Units. Moreover, assignment
tests were employed to determine contemporary migration events
and source/sink populations. Our results show that populations
within this MPA have high conservation value. However, we also
identify other populations of conservation interest. {\textcopyright} EDP

The result of this complex interaction also affects sediment dynamics in and around submersed macrophyte beds. This review defines known relationships and identifies areas that need additional research on the complex interactions among submersed macrophytes, water movement, and sediment dynamics. Four areas are addressed: (1) the effects of water movement on macrophytes, (2) the effects of macrophyte stands on water movement, (3) the effects of macrophyte beds on sedimentation within vegetated areas, and (4) the relationship between sediment resuspension and macrophytes.Water movement has a significant effect on macrophyte growth, typically stimulating both abundance and diversity of macrophytes at low to moderate velocities, but reducing growth at higher velocities. In turn, macrophyte beds reduce current velocities both within and adjacent to the beds, resulting in increased sedimentation and reduced turbidity. Reduced turbidity increases light availability to macrophytes, increasing their growth. Additionally, macrophytes affect the distribution, composition and particle size of sediments in both freshwater and marine environments. Therefore, establishment and persistence of macrophytes in both marine and freshwater environments provide important ecosystem services, including: (1) improving water quality; and (2) stabilizing sediments, reducing sediment resuspension, erosion and turbidity.},

different conditions of life. Ephemeral biotic substrata (mainly
uprooted macroalgae) may be used for transport and food,

major threat for local population persistence of I. metallica.
Abiotic substrata or wood represent efficient vectors for

species. In laboratory experiments, the spatially-limited
conditions of drifting substrata were simulated in microcosms.
Idotea metallica established persistent populations on both
types of substrata. On abiotic substrata, however, where the
animals were fed only on Artemia larvae, high variations in
density and a reduced intrinsic rate of population growth
increased the risk of population extinction. Idotea metallica
avoids habitat destruction by limited feeding on macroalgae. In

destroyed algal habitats by feeding about 10 times faster than

Ecotoxicology and ecology have shown similar developmental

intrinsically (e.g., as part of test species selection) - the
latter is preferable. General guidelines for acute and chronic
testing and criteria for species selection differ for
ecotoxicology and environmental toxicology, and are outlined. An

Four major assemblages, comprising zooplankton, kelp-associated spe- cies, inter-island and nearshore benthos, were considered. Despite consumers exhibiting a pre- dictable enrichment in $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N with trophic position, only the zooplankton community dis- played distinct trophic levels. The benthic and the kelp-associated communities showed trophic continua. Both pelagic (zooplankton) and benthic inter-island communities ultimately derived their diets from phytoplankton (associated with surface-water POM). However, planktonic grazers fed pri- marily on allochthonous nano- and pico-plankton, while inter-island benthos seemed to rely mostly on microphytoplankton derived from autochthonous blooms. In contrast, kelp-associated animals derived a high proportion of their diet from kelp. The nearshore benthic community had an inter- mediate position between kelp-associated and inter-island communities. While POM was of primary importance, kelp-derived organic matter accounted on average for {\textgreater}30{\%} of the nearshore animals' diet. Findings of the present study indicate for the first time that autochthonous sources of organic matter (e.g. kelp-derived and microphytoplankton blooms), are important components of the diets of all but the zooplankton community at the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands.},

preferred habitats for testing species interaction and the
experimental evaluation of general theories. Kelp associations
differ geographically and structurally. A variety of natural
phenomena related to the structure and organization of
communities should be considered. The identification of
mechanisms is important but should be implemented by
experimental studies on biological and physical interactions

kelp Laminaria hyperborea along a wave-exposure gradient in
western Norway. The distribution of L. hyperborea is positively
related to wave exposure, and the present work aimed to study how
demography and population dynamics are affected by wave exposure.
Populations at 9 sites representing 3 different levels of wave
exposure were investi- gated. The biomass and production of L.
hyperborea doubled along the gradient from low- to high-exposure
sites. This increase was caused by an increase in plant density
and individual plant size. Recruits and sub-canopy plants made up
the majority of all individuals at all sites, but poten- tial
recruitment increased more than mortality rate among recruits and
young sub-canopy plants as wave exposure increased, leading to a
higher density of these small individuals at high- exposure
sites. Despite their large numbers, recruits and sub-canopy
plants were not important for total biomass and production, and
variations in those parameters with wave exposure were largely
driven by variations in the density and size of adult canopy
plants. Canopy plants suffered higher rates of mortality at low
wave exposure, leading to shorter longevity and lower density
than at high-exposure sites. The density and individual size of
canopy plants both increased by ca. 50{\%} with increasing wave
exposure, explaining the higher biomass and productivity at high-
exposure sites. We suggest that the high mortality rate, low
density and small size of canopy plants at low-exposure sites is
caused by a combination of high epiphytic load and self-shading,
which may impair light conditions, affect nutrient uptake and
increase drag on the blades during extreme wind events. The
reason why plants at high-exposure sites reach a larger
individual size remains unknown},

Response variables considered in the study included biomass production, shoot density, shoot length, and various characteristics of leaf form.Total biomass production in all species generally increased with both increasing light and increasing temperature (to at least 28 °C). However, variations in biomass and other parameters as well were highly influenced by the interactive relationship between light and temperature. Shoot density correlated directly with biomass production in these species under all experimental conditions. In contrast, light and temperature elicited opposing responses in shoot length, which decreased with increasing light but increased with increasing temperature. The extent of variations in leaf morphology differed among species, apparently reflecting intrinsic differences in heterophyllous capabilities.Light and temperature appear to interact in influencing lower limits of macrophyte depth distribution and related variations in the duration of seasonal growth. Temperature is likely to assert a strong influence on the latitudinal distribution of submersed freshwater macrophytes, dependent upon species-specific differences in response to temperature and basic differences in macrophyte life cycle.},

abstract = {The morphological and reproductive development of gametophytes of Ecklonia maxima (Osbeck) Papenf. has been studied in vitro under a wide range of light and temperature conditions, and the results related to the natural environment over the range of the distribution of the species. Initial vegetative growth was light saturated at 20 E m-2 s-1, and maximal at 17.5° and 20°C. Most rapid egg production corresponded to low cell number of female gametophytes, and this process was light saturated at 60 E m-2 s-1, and optimised at 15° and 17.5°C. Cell number was also low at lower temperatures, with reduced fertility rates. Sub-saturating irradiances and supraoptimal temperatures caused females to become filamentous, producing many more cells, and reducing reproductive rates. The final egg production per female was, however, greater in these sub-optimal conditions, and this phenomenon is interpreted as an ecological adaptation which improves survival prospects in conditions prevailing at the fringes of the depth and geographical distribution of the species. The optimal, and maximum (22.5°C) temperatures for reproduction are far higher than those of northern hemisphere Laminarians. E. maxima is very much a warm temperate organism, and this could have implications for marine phytogeographical studies on the west coast of southern Africa.},

abstract = {There is concern about historical and continuing loss of canopy-forming algae across the world's temperate coastline. In South Australia, the sparse cover of canopy-forming algae on the Adelaide metropolitan coast has been of public concern with continuous years of anecdotal evidence culminating in 2 competing views. One view considers that current patterns existed before the onset of urbanisation, whereas the alternate view is that they developed after urbanisation. We tested hypothe- ses to distinguish between these 2 models, each centred on the reconstruction of historical covers of canopies on the metropolitan coast. Historically, the metropolitan sites were indistinguishable from con- temporary populations of reference sites across 70 km (i.e. Gulf St. Vincent), and could also represent a random subset of exposed coastal sites across 2100 km of the greater biogeographic province. Thus there was nothing ‘special' about the metropolitan sites historically, but today they stand out because they have sparser covers of canopies compared to equivalent locations and times in the gulf and the greater province. This is evidence of wholesale loss of canopy-forming algae (up to 70{\%}) on parts of the Adelaide metropolitan coast since major urbanisation. These findings not only set a research agenda based on the magnitude of loss, but they also bring into question the logic that smaller metropolitan populations of humans create impacts that are trivial relative to that of larger metropolitan centres. Instead, we highlight a need to recognise the ecological context that makes some coastal systems more vulnerable or resistant to increasing human-domination of the world's coastlines. We discuss challenges to this kind of research that receive little ecological discussion, particularly better leadership and administration, recognising that the systems we study out-live the life spans of individual research groups and operate on spatial scales that exceed the capacity of single research providers.

abstract = {The American lobster Homarus americanus and kelp Laminaria
longicruris and L. saccharina are prominent and often intimately
associated members of the subtidal community in the western North
Atlantic Ocean. However, no one has identified the nature of this
relationship or specifically investigated whether kelp beds are a
superior habitat for lobsters. We conducted field studies in 1990
and 1991 at a coastal site centrally located along the Gulf of
Maine, USA, to determine how lobsters use kelp beds as habitat.
Identically sized and spaced plots of live and artificial
(plastic) kelp were established and monitored for lobster
population densities. Adjacent featureless sediment plots of
identical size served as controls. Lobster population density and
biomass were significantly higher in both real and artificial
kelp treatments than in non-kelp control plots (p {\textless} 0.0001). The
change in lobster density was apparent the day following
placement of the experiment, so a secondary trophic effect such
as attracting prey into treatments is unlikely to have occurred.
Thus, kelp beds can affect local lobster population densities by
providing shelter for lobsters, thereby concentrating individuals
and increasing the local carrying capacity of potential lobster
habitats. The effect of kelp beds on the local carrying capacity
of lobster habitats was further explored by testing how lobsters
respond to differing patch sizes. A graded size series of
circular patches of artificial kelp was established, in which
kelp blade density and total area were held constant for each
treatment. Treatments were subdivided into four 1 M2, two 2 M2,
or one 4 m2 patches. Experiments were surveyed for lobster
population density and size structure to determine ff statistical
differences existed among treatments. Lobster density was
significantly greater in the smallest patches (p {\textless} 0.001).
Moreover, lobsters typically occupied the edges of kelp beds, and
their abundance within kelp patches corresponded to the patch's
perimeter-to-area relationship. This suggests that edge effects'
influence the local carrying capacity for lobsters by influencing
the lobsters' choice of kelp beds as habitat.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Theory and research suggest that sensory processing
sensitivity (SPS), found in roughly 20{\%} of humans and over 100
other species, is a trait associated with greater sensitivity
and responsiveness to the environment and to social stimuli.
Self-report studies have shown that high-SPS individuals are
strongly affected by others' moods, but no previous study has
examined neural systems engaged in response to others' emotions.
METHODS: This study examined the neural correlates of SPS
(measured by the standard short-form Highly Sensitive Person
[HSP] scale) among 18 participants (10 females) while viewing
photos of their romantic partners and of strangers displaying
positive, negative, or neutral facial expressions. One year
apart, 13 of the 18 participants were scanned twice. RESULTS:
Across all conditions, HSP scores were associated with increased
brain activation of regions involved in attention and action
planning (in the cingulate and premotor area [PMA]). For happy
and sad photo conditions, SPS was associated with activation of
brain regions involved in awareness, integration of sensory
information, empathy, and action planning (e.g., cingulate,
insula, inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], middle temporal gyrus
[MTG], and PMA). CONCLUSIONS: As predicted, for partner images
and for happy facial photos, HSP scores were associated with
stronger activation of brain regions involved in awareness,
empathy, and self-other processing. These results provide
evidence that awareness and responsiveness are fundamental
features of SPS, and show how the brain may mediate these
traits.},

abstract = {The shallow subtidal rocky habitats in most temperate coastal areas are con- spicuously dominated by large brown algae in the orders Laminariales and Fucales. These algae are commonly referred to as kelps, although the term technically refers to Laminariales only. Their high productivity and com- plicated biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities. For this reason, these communities havc received a great deal of research, including one of the first scientific applications of diving (128). This review summarizes the status of research programs operating within very different scales and emphasizes the point that a real understanding of the processes under study must come from the proper perspective and integration of the other levels. A taxonomic account of the world's kelps is far too complex for the scope of this review, but Mann (146) has characterized the world's kelp forests by their dominant genera. Laminaria species are found in many parts of the world but dominate both sides of the Atlantic and the coasts of China and Japan. Ecklonia dominates some kelp forests in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and a few other southern hemisphere localities. The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forms dense tbrests in many parts of the world including areas of the northeast Pacific, the southern shores of South America, many Southern Ocean islands, and isolated areas of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Macrocystis pyriJora does not occur in the eastern Pacific area north of San Francisco, California; however, this northern region has the highest species diversity of kelps in the world (63), with Macrocystis integrifolia and Nereocystis, Alaria, Pterygophora, and Laminaria, among other conspicuous genera. *The US Government has the right to retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license in and to any copyright covering this paper. 215 Annual Reviews www.annualreviews.org/aronline 216 DAYTON Annu.

The life cycle of all kelps consists of an alternation of generations between microscopic haploid gametophytes and large diploid sporophytes which pro- dhce reproductive sori, often on specialized sporophylls. Reduction division occurs in the sporangium, producing microscopic zoospores which are released to settle on the bottom and develop into male and female gametophytes. Gametophytes produce antheridia and oogonia; fertilization results in zygote formation and the growth of sporophytes. Most ecological studies have focused on the large sporophyte stage; however, recent work emphasizes the different threshold factors important to the separate life-history stages, especially the gametophytes and juvenile stages (50, 205). This review is possible because the huge and often rather diffuse literature has received excellent reviews (21, 80, 119, 146, 158, 183, 205). ! will emphasize the kelp community models being developed in the northeastern Pacific because of my own familiarity with the system.

abstract = {Factors influencing the early colonization by benthic macroalgae and the early successional sequence in a subtidal Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh forest in Port Jackson (Sydney) were investigated using controlled experiments involving the microscopic sampling of settlement plates. The preliminary results indicate that the Tolerance model of succession may be applicable. The effect of grazers, and competition between different algal types were important and could, later in the succession, lead to the operation of the mechanisms suggested by the Facilitation or Inhibition models. Controls for the use of settlement plates showed that thick settlement plates led to an over-estimation of initial algal growth compared with the growth on natural patches of substratum. Other results suggested that thick plates excluded grazers. Borders of plates were investigated, but the establishment of algae was random over the plates′ surfaces and border effects were the result of physical or biotic factors acting on algae after settlement. An experiment was developed for use in subtidal areas to test for artifacts due to cages. It was found that the presence of the cages influences the community by attracting small snails. Fish were excluded from some areas to monitor their effects on initial algal growth. Exclusion of fish was found to cause a reduction in algal growth as well as increases in numbers of small invertebrates such as amphipods and copepods. The results suggested that the amount of algae initially present was affected by invertebrate grazers, the abundances of which were, in turn, affected by predation. The species diversity of the early algal growth did not show any consistent trends between high and low grazing pressure. Grazing was important in determining the temporal variability of early growth of individual species. Siltation was positively correlated with early algal growth; a mechanism to account for this effect is suggested. The application of the methods used in this study to future experimental studies of sublittoral community dynamics is considered.},

metres above sea level. Overall, this zone covers 2 per cent of

disproportionate number of the countries with a large share of
their population in this zone are small island countries, but
most of the countries with large populations in the zone are
large countries with heavily populated delta regions. On
average, the Least Developed Countries have a higher share of
their population living in the zone (14 per cent) than do OECD
countries (10 per cent), with even greater disparities in the
urban shares (21 per cent compared to 11 per cent). Almost
two-thirds of urban settlements with populations greater than 5
million fall, at least partly, in the zone. In some countries

abstract = {Ocean circulation models are widely used to simulate organism
transport in the open sea, where challenges of directly tracking
organisms across vast spatial and temporal scales are daunting.
Many recent studies tout the use of 'high-resolution' models,
which are forced with atmospheric data on the scale of several
hours and integrated with a time step of several minutes or
seconds. However, in many cases, the model's outputs that are
used to simulate organism movement have been averaged to
considerably coarser resolutions (e.g. monthly mean velocity
fields). To examine the sensitivity of tracking results to ocean
circulation model output resolution, we took the native model
output of one of the most sophisticated ocean circulation models
available, the Global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, and averaged
it to commonly implemented spatial and temporal resolutions in
studies of basin-scale dispersal. Comparisons between simulated
particle trajectories and in situ near-surface drifter
trajectories indicated that 'over averaging' model output yields
predictions inconsistent with observations. Further analyses
focused on the dispersal of juvenile sea turtles indicate that
very different inferences regarding the pelagic ecology of these
animals are obtained depending on the resolution of model output.
We conclude that physical processes occurring at the scale of
days and tens of kilometres should be preserved in ocean
circulation model output to realistically depict the movement
marine organisms and the resulting ecological and evolutionary
processes.},

abstract = {Connectivity via the transport of detrital material from areas of high to low productivity may be an important determinant of secondary productivity and biodiversity in receiving communi- ties. On the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, detritus exported from subtidal kelp beds contributes to food webs in communities inhabiting deeper waters offshore. To estimate the amount of energy available via this pathway, we measured rates of detrital production via erosion of kelp blades in kelp beds at 5 sites varying in wave exposure. Specifically, we measured productivity and erosion of the 2 dominant species of kelp, Laminaria digitata and Saccharina longicruris, over 16 mo. We also examined the effect of environmental and biological factors on erosion rates, including temperature, wave exposure, grazing by snails and cover by the invasive bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. We observed clear seasonal and spatial patterns in productivity, with the highest production in spring. Erosion rate was highly variable across sites and seasons, and was strongly related to the cover of M. membranacea and the intensity of snail grazing at the distal end of kelp blades. Both factors cause tissue degradation, abrasions and perforations that weaken blades. Erosion rate was also positively related to water temperature and site exposure. Annual detrital production from the erosion of kelp blades increased linearly with kelp bed biomass, and ranged from 0.5 to 1.71 kg dry weight m–2 (150–513 g C m–2) across sites. These rates equal or exceed annual phytoplankton production off the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia and estimates of detrital production in seagrass beds in North America. KEY},

abstract = {In proximity of shelters, grazing by sea urchins plays a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining areas dominated by encrusting corallines. Much attention has been given to the effects of urchins on algal assemblages in shallow subtidal reefs, but few studies attempted to clarify the role played by encrusting coralline algae in this system. It has been shown that encrusting corallines are able to reduce settlement of potential competitors, suggesting that they do not rely on grazing by herbivores to prevent swamping by erect algal species. In shallow subtidal reefs of the Mediterranean Sea, the sea urchins Para centrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula are the main herbivores, whose grazing commonly leads to a mosaic of areas dominated alternatively by encrusting corallines and turf-forming algae. This study aims to separate the effects of urchins and encrusting corallines on the re-colonisation of encrusting coralline-dominated patches (barren habitat) by surrounding erect algal species (turf-forming algae). Different hypotheses were tested by means of multivariate and univariate analyses. The multivariate hypothesis was that the algal assemblage developing when encrusting corallines and urchins are simultaneously removed would be more similar to that establishing in stands of turf-forming algae, than that developing when none or only 1 of the 2 factors is manipulated. The univariate hypotheses tested were: (1) that there is a negative effect of sea urchins and encrusting corallines on the re-colonisation of barren areas by surrounding turf-forming algal species and (2) that the effects of encrusting corallines are weaker than those of urchins, but that they operate in the same direction. These hypotheses were tested by means of an orthogonal manipulation of urchins and encrusting corallines. At each of 3 study sites, 2 replicate barren patches were assigned to each of these treatments: (1) +corallines+urchins; (2) +corallines-urchins; (3) -corallines+urchins; (4) -corallines-urchins. The results suggest that the occurrence of areas dominated by encrusting corallines on shallow subtidal reefs in the northwest Mediterranean is not simply the result of grazing by sea urchins on turf-forming species. The removal of encrusting corallines also affected the abundance of dominant algal species and determined the development of an algal assemblage resembling those occurring within stands of algal turfs. The effects of the removal of urchins on turf-forming species were generally positive, while those of encrusting corallines varied from negative (Padina pavonica) to positive (Acetabularia acetabulum and filamentous algae). Therefore, the role played by encrusting corallines in maintaining alternative habitats on shallow subtidal reefs should be taken into account, thus avoiding the overestimation of the effects of grazing by sea urchins.},

organisms to faster flow higher in the water column than near
the substratum, potentially increasing rates of mass exchange
while also exposing the organisms to higher hydrodynamic forces.
Benthic organisms maintain upright postures in the water column
by one of two mechanisms, stiffness or buoyancy. Turbinaria
ornata is a tropical macroalga that uses either buoyancy or
flexural stiffness (EI), depending on its flow habitat. This
study used physical models of T. ornata to compare the effect of
different magnitudes of these two mechanisms on relative water
velocity and hydrodynamic forces in both unidirectional and wavy
flow. Models of the alga were constructed to span and exceed
natural levels of T. ornata's EI and buoyancy. Models with high
EI and high buoyancy maintained upright postures in both
unidirectional flow and waves, and experienced higher forces
than models with low EI and moderate or low buoyancy that
deflected in the direction of water motion. In waves, buoyant
models that were deflected by high velocity rebounded back into
upright positions when the flow slowed. Non-buoyant, flexible
models were also pushed over by flow but lacked the ability to
rebound upright, which led to decreased force in unidirectional
flow, but high force in waves.},

abstract = {Based primarily on genetic data, it has been proposed that Homo
sapiens followed a coastal `Southern Dispersal Route' from
Africa to Island Southeast Asia and Australia between ∼100,000
and 50,000 years ago. Geographic Information System (GIS)-based
modelling has suggested that humans followed coastlines and
rivers through the region, with the large Indus and Ganges river
deltas providing formidable barriers to human migration.
Archaeological evidence for such a coastal dispersal is
virtually absent in East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and
south-central Asia, however, creating a lively debate about the
potential of coastal versus interior dispersal routes. We
analyze south Asian coastlines and consider the potential
effects of post-glacial sea level rise on the preservation of
Pleistocene coastal sites to identify areas where archaeologists
might search for evidence of early human dispersals along Asia's
south coast, including the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian
subcontinent. We also explore the ecology of mangrove and other
coastal ecosystems from East Africa to Australia, where the
Indian Ocean gyre facilitates the broad dispersal of marine
organisms, including biologically rich and diverse mangrove
forests. The presence of similar ecosystems and species around
much of the Indian Ocean margins may have facilitated the
dispersal of coastal peoples. Rather than a barrier, large
mangrove forests may have attracted coastal groups, whose
foraging in such ecosystems could have spurred the development
of the sophisticated watercraft needed to colonize the island
arcs of Southeast Asia and western Melanesia.},

abstract = {This contribution details a simple empirical model for
forecasting shoreline positions at seasonal to interannual
time-scales. The one-dimensional (1-D) model is a simplification
of a 2-D behavioural-template model proposed by Davidson and
Turner (2009). The new model is calibrated and tested using
five-years of weekly video-derived shoreline data from the Gold
Coast, Australia. The modelling approach first utilises a
least-squares methodology to calibrate the empirical model
coefficients using the first half of the dataset of observed
shoreline movement in response to known forcing by waves. The
model is then verified by comparison of hindcast shoreline
positions to the second half of the observed shoreline dataset.
One thousand synthetic time-series of wave height and period are
generated that encapsulate the statistical characteristics of
the modelled wave field, retaining the observed seasonal
variability and sequencing characteristics. The calibrated model
is used in conjunction with the simulated wave time-series to
perform Monte Carlo forecasting of the resulting shoreline
positions. The ensemble-mean of the 1000 individual five-year
shoreline simulations is compared to the unseen shoreline
time-series. A simple linear trend forecast of the shoreline
position was used as a baseline for assessing the performance of
the model. The model performance relative to this baseline
prediction was quantified by several objective methods,
including cross-correlation (r), root mean square (RMS) error
analysis and Brier Skill tests. Importantly, these tests
involved no prior knowledge of either the wave forcing or
shoreline response. The new forecast model was found to
significantly improve shoreline predictions relative to the
simple linear trend model, capturing well both the trend and
seasonal shoreline variabilities observed at this site. Brier
Skill Scores (BSS) indicate that the model forecasts based on
unseen data were rated as `excellent' (BSS=0.83), and root mean
square errors were less than 7m (≈14{\%} of the observed
variability). The standard deviations of the 1000 individual
simulations from ensemble-averaged `mean' forecast were found to
provide a useful means of predicting the higher-frequency
(individual storm) shoreline variability, with 98{\%} of the
observed shoreline data falling within two standard deviations
of the forecast position.},

Here, we test the influence of nearshore winds, tidal currents
and position of release (low, mid or high tidal zone) on the
dispersal of drifting fucoid algae were tested. ``Drift sets''
(tagged Hormosira banksii, Durvillaea antarctica, Cystophora
torulosa and GPS drifters) were tracked over single tidal
cycles. Wind direction had the greatest effect on movement of
drift sets, but interacted with tidal direction. Overall,
offshore winds and outgoing tides were most favourable for LDD,
but their effect differed between species. Approximately 90{\%} of
H. banksii, D. antarctica and GPS-tracked drifters were
beach-cast after one tidal cycle during onshore winds, while
19{\%} were beach-cast during offshore winds. In contrast, 50–75{\%}
of C. torulosa were beach-cast after one tide, regardless of
wind direction. Displacement of drifters was affected by tidal
zone of release, but interacted with wind and tidal direction.
Drifting velocities varied between drifter types, with surface
drifters travelling further and faster than the benthic-drifting
species. Analysis of 20years of wind data found seasonal
differences in the percentage of hourly winds, with greater
periods of south-westerly and north-westerly winds, and fewer
onshore north-easterly winds, during autumn and winter periods.
Conditions for successful offshore dispersal from the major
algal dominated peninsulas of southern New Zealand are,
therefore, more likely to occur if detachment of algae occurs
during outgoing tides in autumn and winter.},

that takes into account contributions of phytoplankton,
non-chlorophyllous particles and dissolved organic matter. The
model is based on theoretical considerations and is validated by
comparison with observed reflectance spectra. It is then used to
address the problem of estimating chlorophyll concentration in
coastal (case 2) waters by remote sensing. Principal component
analysis is carried out on a large number of reflectance spectra
simulated using the model. The results indicate the possibility
of chlorophyll retrieval in at least some case 2 waters.
Retrieval becomes difficult in waters where the signal from
small quantities of chlorophyll is drowned in the noise from
large quantities of non-chlorophyllous particles and dissolved
organic matter. Non-chlorophyllous particles are the most easy
to recover, while dissolved organic matter appears to be the
most difficult. The non-linearity of the system limits the
possibility of a single algorithm to cover all ranges of
variation. It appears possible to pass from full spectral data
to five selected wavelengths without any loss in the retrieval
efficiencies. The use of 400 nm-channel data in the algorithm,
in addition to the data from the usual 440, 520 and 550nm
channels, considerably increases the possibility of
distinguishing phytoplankton from dissolved organic matter.},

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was fractionated by ultrafiltration into 1-30 kDa (HDOM) and 30 kDa-0.2 $\mu$m (VHDOM) nominal molecular weight fractions. Thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) was used to release and quantify lipids and lignin phenols. Stable carbon isotopes, fatty acids and lignin content indicated shifts in sources with terrigenous material in the river and turbid region and a predominantly algal/planktonic signal in the lower estuary and coastal ocean. Thermochemolysis with TMAH released significant amounts of short chain fatty acids (C9-C13), not seen by traditional alkaline hydrolysis, which appear to be associated with the macromolecular matrix. Lignin phenol distributions in HDOM, VHDOM and particles followed predicted sources with higher concentrations in the river and turbid region of the estuary and lower concentrations in the coastal ocean. TOM comprised 12{\%} of HDOM within the coastal ocean and up to 73{\%} of HDOM within the turbid region of the estuary. In the coastal ocean, TOM from high molecular weight DOM comprised 4{\%} of total DOC. The annual flux of TOM from the Delaware Estuary to the coastal ocean was estimated at 2.0×1010g OC year-1and suggests that temperate estuaries such as Delaware Bay can be significant sources of TOM on a regional scale. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The distributions and abundances of species and populations
change almost continu- ously. Understanding the processes
responsible is perhaps ecologyʼs most fundamental challenge.
Kelp-forest ecosystems in southwest Alaska have undergone several
phase shifts between alga- and herbivore-dominated states in
recent decades. Overhunting and recovery of sea otters caused the
earlier shifts. Studies focusing on these changes demonstrate the
importance of top-down forcing processes, a variety of indirect
food- web interactions associated with the otter-urchin-kelp
trophic cascade, and the role of food-chain length in the
coevolution of defense and resistance in plants and their her-
bivores. This system unexpectedly shifted back to an
herbivore-dominated state during the 1990s, because of a
sea-otter population collapse that apparently was driven by
increased predation by killer whales. Reasons for this change
remain uncertain but seem to be linked to the whole-sale collapse
of marine mammals in the North Pacific Ocean and southern Bering
Sea. We hypothesize that killer whales sequentially ``fished
down'' pinniped and sea-otter populations after their earlier
prey, the great whales, were decimated by commercial whaling. The
dynamics of kelp forests in southwest Alaska thus appears to have
been influenced by an ecological chain reaction that encompassed
numerous species and large scales of space and time.},

before the Holocene, likely at the end of the Last Glacial

via rafting. Furthermore, the remarkably low microsatellite
diversity found in the Chilean populations compared to those in
New Zealand is consistent with a recent genetic bottleneck as a
result of over-exploitation of natural populations and/or the
process of domestication. Therefore, the aquaculture of this

abstract = {Two distinct organizational states of kelp forest communities,
foliose algal assemblages and deforested barren areas, typically
display sharp discontinuities. Mecha- nisms responsible for
maintaining these state differences were studied by manipulating
various features of their boundary regions. Urchins in the barren
areas had significantly smaller gonads than those in adjacent
kelp stands, implying that food was a limiting resource for
urchins in the barrens. The abundance of drift algae and living
foliose algae varied abruptly across the boundary between kelp
beds and barren areas. These observations raise the question of
why urchins from barrens do not invade kelp stands to improve
their fitness. By manipulating kelp and urchin densities at
boundary regions and within kelp beds, we tested the hypothesis
that kelp stands inhibit invasion of urchins. Urchins that were
ex- perimentally added to kelp beds persisted and reduced kelp
abundance until winter storms either swept the urchins away or
caused them to seek refuge within crevices. Urchins invaded kelp
bed margins when foliose algae were removed but were prevented
from doing so when kelps were replaced with physical models. The
sweeping motion of kelps over the seafloor apparently inhibits
urchins from crossing the boundary between kelp stands and barren
areas, thus maintaining these alternate stable states. Our
findings suggest that kelp stands are able to defend themselves
from their most important herbivores by combining their flexible
morphology with the energy of wave-generated surge. The
inhibitory influence of this interaction may be an important
mechanism maintaining the patchwork mosaics of barren areas and
kelp beds that characterize many kelp forest ecosystems.},

abstract = {Past model studies have projected a global decrease in marine
net primary production (NPP) over the 21st century, but these
studies focused on the multi-model mean rather than on the large
inter-model differences. Here, we analyze model-simulated
changes in NPP for the 21st century under IPCC's high-emission
scenario RCP8.5. We use a suite of nine coupled carbon–climate
Earth system models with embedded marine ecosystem models and
focus on the spread between the different models and the
underlying reasons. Globally, NPP decreases in five out of the
nine models over the course of the 21st century, while three
show no significant trend and one even simulates an increase.
The largest model spread occurs in the low latitudes (between
30° S and 30° N), with individual models simulating relative
changes between −25 and +40 {\%}. Of the seven models diagnosing a
net decrease in NPP in the low latitudes, only three simulate
this to be a consequence of the classical interpretation, i.e.,
a stronger nutrient limitation due to increased stratification
leading to reduced phytoplankton growth. In the other four,
warming-induced increases in phytoplankton growth outbalance the
stronger nutrient limitation. However, temperature-driven
increases in grazing and other loss processes cause a net
decrease in phytoplankton biomass and reduce NPP despite higher
growth rates. One model projects a strong increase in NPP in the
low latitudes, caused by an intensification of the microbial
loop, while NPP in the remaining model changes by less than 0.5
{\%}. While models consistently project increases NPP in the
Southern Ocean, the regional inter-model range is also very
substantial. In most models, this increase in NPP is driven by
temperature, but it is also modulated by changes in light,
macronutrients and iron as well as grazing. Overall, current
projections of future changes in global marine NPP are subject
to large uncertainties and necessitate a dedicated and sustained
effort to improve the models and the concepts and data that
guide their development.},

abstract = {I experimentally separated the positive and negative effects of light penetration and sedimentation on the assembly and maintenance of 3 subtidal habitats whose heterogeneity charac- terizes much of the world's temperate coastline; encrusting (non-geniculate) coralline algae, articu- lated (geniculate) coralline algae and filamentous, turf-forming algae. The ability of encrusting corallines to monopolize and retain space without overgrowth depended on the presence of shade (positive effect) if sediment deposition was below that observed on coast characterized by high rates of sedimentation (negative effect). In contrast, the growth and persistence of articulated corallines depended on the absence of shade (negative effect) and high levels of sediment accumulation observed on human-dominated coast (positive effect). The recruitment of filamentous-turfs was facil- itated by full light, but was not strongly affected by sedimentation. Instead, filamentous-turfs toler- ated heavy sediment accumulation, a factor thought to explain the concomitant increase in spatial dominance of algal-turfs and loss of canopy-forming algae on reefs with heavy sedimentation. Impor- tantly, different habitats will assemble or be maintained to match the environmental conditions in which they are most extensive, demonstrating the key role of physical factors associated with habi- tat-formers (kelp forests) and human-dominated coast (heavy sedimentation). These results also demonstrate that an appreciation of the integrated roles of physical processes may assist the devel- opment of predictive models about the assembly and maintenance of heterogeneity of natural com- munities, and their potential disruption by humans.

abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have horizontal
scales of hundreds of kilometers and depth scales of hundreds of
meters. In terms of coastal dynamics, they behave much like
inland seas and exhibit physical processes characteristic of the
coastal oceans. The lakes are dynamically similar to the coastal
ocean in that their horizontal dimensions are larger than the
vertical dimensions, and the principal source of mechanical
energy is the wind. The major difference in dynamical processes
is that the lakes are enclosed basins and are not connected to
the deep ocean. This paper presents an overview of some of the
significant aspects of physical processes in the coastal zones
of the Great Lakes. The review is based on examples ranging from
lake-wide experiments like the International Field Year on the
Great Lakes (IFYGL) to several process-oriented coastal boundary
layer experiments. The basic circulations in the nearshore zone
and coastal boundary layer are summarized. The review concludes
with suggestions for future work on the understanding of the
physical processes that would have a bearing on lake management
in the coastal zones of the Great Lakes.},

abstract = {In February 1998, Jasus edwardsii larval catches off the east coast of New Zealand were binomial in size and stage of development. Mid-stage larvae (presumed to be from the 1997 cohort) appeared to be contained within a large permanent eddy found offshore, known as the Wairarapa Eddy. Late-stage larvae (1996 cohort) have a different distribution from the mid-stage larvae, being found closer inshore of the eddy. Pueruli (also 1996 cohort) were found well inshore of the eddy. Surface currents derived from TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter measurements of sea level are used to simulate larval concentrations. The numerical simulations show that the different distributions of the 3 groups cannot be explained on the basis of advection alone. Mid-stage concentrations appear to be well described by passive drift alone, but the simulations suggest some mechanism inducing shoreward transport is needed for both pueruli and late-stage phyllosomas. Observed puerulus concentrations are best matched by adding a shorewards-directed speed of 8 to 10 cm/s for between 1 and 3 wk before the date of the cruise. Late-stage phyllosoma concentrations are best matched by adding speeds of 4 to 6 cm/s. Sustained shorewards swimming speeds of 8 to 10 cm/s are well within the estimates of swimming speed that have been reported elsewhere for pueruli. To our knowledge, extended directed horizontal swimming has not been reported for phyllosomas, yet in the final stage, the pleopods are almost as well developed as they are in the pueruli. These final stage larvae could well use forward pleopod propulsion, in conjunction with exopodal setai beating, to allow them to swim.},

that species grew faster in the artificial kelp treatment. The

Biomass data were converted to estimates of annual growth of lamina, stipe and hapteron. Allocation of annual growth to the hapteron constituted a small amount of the total production, but increased with increasing wave exposure. At the most sheltered locality, lamina growth amounted to between 80 and 95{\%} of total growth in all age groups, and lamina to stipe ratios (fresh weight) were about 10. A higher portion of the annual growth was allocated to the stipe at the more wave-exposed localities. This resulted in lamina to stipe ratios of between 1 and 2 in old plants, but within these localities no gradual decrease in lamina to stipe ratio with increasing wave exposure was observed. At some localities a maximum of growth allocation to the stipe was found in the intermediate age groups. This was most pronounced at the locality with the highest density of canopy plants and intermediate wave exposure. Also, at this locallty the stipes were longer in relation to their weight than at the other localities. These results indicate that light environment, in additlon to wave exposure, Inay influence the stipe morphology and the relationship between stipe and lamina growth. At one station stipe growth was also calculated in individual tagged plants using the length-weight relationship. The results agreed with those obtained by the biomass method. The highest allo-cation of growth to the stipes was found in 3 and 4 yr old plants. Maximum annual stipe growth (weight increase) occurred in 4 and 5 yr old plants and decreased in older plants, while maximum lamina growth was found in the oldest plants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population structure and genetic diversity of marine
organisms in the Northwestern Pacific Ocean exhibited complex
patterns. Saccharina japonica is a commercially and ecologically
important kelp species widely distributed along the coast of
Japan Sea. However, it is still poorly known about population
genetics and phylogeographic patterns of wild S. japonica
populations on a large geographic scale, which is an important
contribution to breeding and conservation of this marine crop.
RESULTS: We collected 612 mitochondrial COI and trnW-trnL
sequences. Diversity indices suggested that S. japonica
populations along the coast of Hokkaido exhibited the highest
genetic diversity. Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure
(BAPS) revealed four clusters in the kelp species (cluster 1:
Hokkaido and South Korea; cluster 2: northwestern Hokkaido;
cluster 3: Far Eastern Russia; cluster 4: China). The network
inferred from concatenated data exhibited two shallow
genealogies corresponding to two BAPS groups (cluster 2 and
cluster 3). We did not detect gene flow between the two shallow
genealogies, but populations within genealogy have asymmetric
gene exchange. Bayesian skyline plots and neutrality tests
suggested that S. japonica experienced postglacial expansion
around 10.45 ka. CONCLUSIONS: The coast of Hokkaido might be the
origin and diversification center of S. japonica. Gene exchange
among S. japonica populations could be caused by anthropogenic
interference and oceanographic regimes. Postglacial expansions
and gene exchange apparently led to more shared haplotypes and
less differentiation that in turn led to the present shallow
phylogeographical patterns in S. japonica.},

abstract = {[Morphological variation within and among many species of algae show correlated life history traits. The trade-offs of life history traits among different morphs are presumed to be determined by morphology. Form-function hypotheses also predict that algae of different morphological groups exhibit different tolerances to physiological stress, whereas algae within a morphological group respond similarly to stress. We tested this hypothesis by comparing photosynthetic and respiratory responses to variation in season, light, temperature, desiccation and freezing among the morphologically similar fronds of Chondrus crispus and Mastocarpus stellatus and the alternate stage crust of M. stellatus. Physiological differences between fronds of the 2 species and crusts and fronds were consistent with their patterns of distribution and abundance in the intertidal zone. However, there was no clear relationship between algal morphology and physiological response to environmental variation. These results suggest that among macroalgae the correlation between life history traits and morphology is not always causal. Rather, the link between life history traits and morphology is constrained by the extent to which physiological characteristics codetermine these features.]},

abstract = {Ocean acidification and warming are affecting polar regions with particular intensity. Rocky shores of the Antarctic Peninsula are dominated by canopy-forming Desmarestiales. This study investigates the physiological and transcriptomic responses of the endemic macroalga Desmarestia anceps to a combination of different levels of temperature (2 and 7 degrees C), dissolved CO2 (380 and 1000 ppm), and irradiance (65 and 145 micromol photons m-2 s-1). Growth and photosynthesis increased at high CO2 conditions, and strongly decreased at 2 degrees C plus high irradiance, in comparison to the other treatments. Photoinhibition at 2 degrees C plus high irradiance was evidenced by the photochemical performance and intensive release of dissolved organic carbon. The highest number of differentially regulated transcripts was observed in thalli exposed to 2 degrees C plus high irradiance. Algal 13C isotopic discrimination values suggested an absence of down-regulation of carbon-concentrating mechanisms at high CO2. CO2 enrichment induced few transcriptomic changes. There was high and constitutive gene expression of many photochemical and inorganic carbon utilization components, which might be related to the strong adaptation of D. anceps to the Antarctic environment. These results suggest that increased temperature and CO2 will allow D. anceps to maintain its productivity while tolerating higher irradiances than at present conditions.},

abstract = {The presence of kelp beds in the water column generates drag to
flows and modifies hydrodynamic processes. In this paper we
examine the modifications of tidal flows in the Hecate Strait by
including an explicit representation of the kelp-induced drag in
a three-dimensional numerical model. The model is evaluated
against a theoretical solution and it agrees well with the
theory. Model results show that kelp beds significantly change
tidal circulation structures by damping tidal velocity by
40–80{\%} in interiors of the beds, but enhancing tidal velocity
by 15{\%} along the edges. Comparing terms in momentum equations
shows that the momentum flux caused by the kelp drag is able to
become a dominant term with a magnitude comparable to that of
the horizontal pressure gradient. Simulating the effects of kelp
beds on particle trajectories shows that the drag due to
kelp-beds decreases the dispersion rate of particles in the
interiors of kelp forests, but increases the dispersion rate
along the edges. Kelp beds form barriers along the edges and
prevent particles from outside entering the interiors of kelp
beds. The dispersion rate is in an inverse relationship to the
kelp density in kelp-bed interiors, while in a positive
relationship to the kelp density along edges.},

abstract = {Understanding the extent to which neutral processes and adaptive divergence shape the spatial structure of natural populations is a major goal in evolutionary biology and is especially important for the identification of significant levels of biodiversity. Our results identified replicated habitat-specific (adaptive) phenotypic divergence in the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus that is independent of population (neutral) genetic structure. F.vesiculosus inhabits contiguous and contrasting marine to estuarine intertidal habitats. Combining analyses of genetic and phenotypic traits of populations living under differential selective regimes (estuaries and open coast), we investigated levels of neutral genetic differentiation and adaptive physiological responses to emersion stress. In southwest England (SW UK) and northern Iberia (N. Iberia), populations living in estuaries and marine coastal habitats were genetically characterized at six microsatellite loci. In N. Iberia, two clades with limited admixture were recovered, each including one open coast site and the adjacent estuarine location. In contrast, SW UK samples clustered according to habitat and formed three distinct groups of genotypes; one including the two open coast locations and the other two representing each of the estuarine sites. Temperature loggers revealed distinct emersion regimes that characterized each habitat type independently of the region, while water and air temperature profiles showed site-specific trends. Despite acclimation under usual conditions, trait means of emersion stress resilience showed a strong phenotypic divergence between habitats, consistent with environmental clines in exposure time observed in the different habitats. We demonstrate that neutral genetic clusters do not reflect locally adapted population units. Our results identified replicated habitat-specific (adaptive) phenotypic divergence that is independent of population (neutral) genetic structure in F.vesiculosus. The significance of such findings extends beyond the theoretical evolutionary and ecological interest of discovering parallel adaptive responses to the broader implications for conservation of intraspecific biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Thirty-nine species of cryptic fishes belonging to 16 families were captured on shallow reefs (0-20 m) in False Bay, South Africa using the ichthyocide rotenone. Five samples were collected in each of four depth zones (0-5, 6-10, 11-15 and 16-20 m). The area from which fish were collected in each sample was measured to give an estimate of density. The overall density of cryptic fishes in the area was 3.41 fish m-2, with the families Congrogadidae and Clinidae being numerically dominant, representing 27.9{\%} and 22.3{\%} of the total sample respectively. The Clinidae were by far the most diverse group, being represented by 17 species, while no other family was represented by more than three species. Multivariate analysis of numerical density revealed that partitioning of spatial resources did occur, with the shallowest samples (0-5 m) forming a group discrete from the deeper samples (6-20 m). Further analysis indicated that the amount of algal cover present was the most important factor influencing community structure, although the abundance of algae is in turn related to depth. The shallowest samples were dominated by members of the families Clinidae, Gobiesocidae and Bythitidae, while the Cheilodactylidae, Tripterygiidae and Ariidae were more important components of deeper water communities (6-20 m). Analysis of percentage volume of prey items in the diets of 21species revealed that only two species shared diets that were more than 50{\%} similar, and that partitioning of trophic resources was considerable.},

abstract = {The subtidal understorey seaweed communities were studied along a coastal distance of 104km around the Cape Peninsula, which is situated in an overlap region between two marine provinces and characterized by a considerable temperature gradient. Sampling was carried out at six sites (4 to 10 quadrats per site) around the Cape Peninsula. For each of the quadrats, biomass of each species, grazing, and environmental variables such as temperature, wave exposure and sand cover were determined. The data were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and two way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). A total of 142 seaweed taxa were found at the six sites (21 Chlorophyta, 14 Phaeophyta and 107 Rhodophyta). The two sides of the Peninsula have a very different biomass-composition of Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta. The biomass of Rhodophyta in the Atlantic sites is much higher than in the Bay, and the biomass of Chlorophyta is higher in False Bay than on the west coast. A change in tloristic composition of subtidal algal communities around the Cape Peninsula can be observed and is principally related to seawater temperature and wave exposure. Next to these physical factors, grazing is demonstrated to be important in determining species composition. A lower degree of wave exposure might result in a higher number of grazers in False Bay. The occurrence of a higher cover of encrusting corallines in the Bay is probably a consequence of the higher grazing pressure. Distinct community types can be recognized from TWINSPAN and CCA.

abstract = {Assessing effects of herbivory across broad gradients of varying
ocean climate conditions and over small spatial scales is crucial
for understanding its influence on primary producers. Effects of
herbivory on the distribution and abundance of kelp recruits were
examined experimentally at two regions under contrasting ocean
climate. Specifically, the abundance and survivorship of kelp
recruits and the abundance of macro-herbivores were compared
between a `cool' and a `warm' region in northern and central
Portugal, respectively. In each region, the abundance of kelp
recruits and the intensity of grazing were compared between
habitats of different topography within reefs (open reef vs.
crevices). Compared to the `warm' region, the abundance of kelp
recruits was 3.9 times greater in the `cool' region, where 85{\%}
of recruits were found in open reef habitats. In contrast, 87{\%}
of recruits in the `warm' region were restricted to crevices. The
`warm' region had 140 times greater abundances of sea urchins, 45
times more herbivorous fish and 4.1 times more grazing marks on
kelp recruits than the `cool' region. Grazing assays showed ca.
50 times higher rates of kelp biomass consumption, mainly by
fishes, and zero survivorship of kelp recruits in the `warm'
relative to the `cool' region. This study suggests both
temperature and herbivores affect abundances of kelp recruits
across latitudes, and demonstrates how herbivores affect their
distribution at local scales, driving kelp recruits into `hiding'
in crevices under intense herbivory. Consequently, where net
recruitment success is compromised by herbivory, the persistence
of kelps will be contingent on availability of topographical
refuges.},

Both ostracods and isopods often invaded the gills, and also often entered the body cavity through the anus, consuming gonads and liver. Laboratory maze experiments showed that ostracods are attracted to chemicals released from sexually mature fishes and by their own bioluminescence. Isopods are attracted to chemicals released by injured fishes, thus they may preferentially attack fishes initially injured by ostracods. Emergent crustacean zooplankton may significantly influence nocturnal versus diurnal distributions and behavior of nearshore fishes. Surveys of commercial fisherman indicated that crustacean zooplankton also cause extensive damage to fishes caught in gill nets, often rendereing a significant percentage of a catch unmarketable.

We show that while metabolic adjustment may assist Australasian kelp beds to persist and maintain abundance in warmer waters, it also reduces the physiological responsiveness of kelps to perturbation, and suppresses canopy recovery from disturbances by reducing the ecological performance of kelp recruits. This provides a warning not to rely solely on inventories of distribution and abundance to evaluate ecosystem function. The erosion of resilience is mediated by a shift in adult-juvenile interactions from competitive under cool to facilitative under warm conditions, supporting the prediction that positive interactions may become increasingly important in a warmer future. Kelp beds may remain intact but with a lower threshold for where additional impacts (e.g., extreme storms or reduced water quality) will lead to persistent loss of habitat and ecological function.},

It is often assumed that ecosystem services are pro- vided linearly (unvaryingly, at a steady rate), but natural processes are characterized by thresholds and limit- ing functions. In this paper, we describe the variability observed in wave attenuation provided by marshes, mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs and therefore also in coastal protection. We calculate the economic con- sequences of assuming coastal protection to be linear. We suggest that, in order to refine ecosystem-based man- agement practices, it is essential that natural variability and cumulative effects be considered in the valuation of ecosystem services.

abstract = {Seaweed-dominated communities are predicted to disappear south
of 45° latitude on North-Atlantic rocky shores by 2200 because
of climate change. The extent of predicted habitat loss,
however, could be mitigated if the seaweeds' physiology is
sufficiently plastic to rapidly acclimatize to the warmer
temperatures. The main objectives of this study were to identify
whether the thermal tolerance of the canopy-forming seaweed
Fucus serratus is population-specific and where temperatures are
likely to exceed its tolerance limits in the next 200 years. We
measured the stress response of seaweed samples from four
populations (Norway, Denmark, Brittany and Spain) to
common-garden heat stress (20 °C-36 °C) in both photosynthetic
performance and transcriptomic upregulation of heat shock
protein genes. The two stress indicators did not correlate and
likely measured different cellular components of the stress
response, but both indicators revealed population-specific
differences, suggesting ecotypic differentiation. Our results
confirmed that thermal extremes will regularly reach
physiologically stressful levels in Brittany (France) and
further south by the end of the 22nd century. Although heat
stress resilience in photosynthetic performance was higher at
the species' southern distributional edge in Spain, the hsp
expression pattern suggested that this edge-population
experienced reduced fitness and limited responsiveness to
further stressors. Thus, F. serratus may be unable to mitigate
its predicted northward shift and may be at high risk to lose
its center of genetic diversity and adaptability in Brittany
(France). As it is an important intertidal key species, the
disappearance of this seaweed will likely trigger major
ecological changes in the entire associated ecosystem.},

environment and many coastal processes are affected by waves and
wave-induced water motion. Directly or indirectly, waves affect
the lives of many coastal macroalgae and seagrasses. Although the
idea that waves can affect macrophyte distribution and
biodiversity is not new, it remains poorly examined. We looked at
how a gradient of wave exposure, determined using the surf
similarity number, influences the species richness of macrophytes
among phyla and functional form groups. We suggest that wave
exposure is a biologically and statistically significant variable
and that the species richness of most phyla and groups decrease
with increasing exposure. More interestingly, the analysis
suggests that the Phaeophyta and the thick-leathery functional
form group, which are associated with important coastal habitats
(i.e. submarine forests), increases in species richness as
exposure increases. It appears that the effect of wave exposure
varies with phyla and functional form group. Consequently, we
reinforce the belief that studies that address the biodiversity
and distribution of macrophytes must include wave exposure as a
measured variable, to provide any meaningful synthesis of the
ecology of these organisms. {\textcopyright} 2010 Japanese Society of Phycology.},

abstract = {To determine the relative importance of different sources of nitrate to the annual nitrogen needs of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, we measured ambient nitrate concentrations at a kelp forest for 13 months and characterized nitrate delivery using water column thermal structure and flow data collected in the forest and at its offshore edge. The forest's monthly nitrate supply varied by a factor of 50, while measured net nitrogen acquisition varied only fivefold. Maximum net nitrogen acquisition rates for fronds in the forest interior were 0.18 mmol N g-1 month-1 during spring upwelling in 2005 and declined fourfold during autumn until upwelling resumed the following year. Modeled gross nitrogen uptake with consideration of Michaelis-Menten kinetics for nitrate and mass transfer limitation was higher than observed net acquisition except during the warm stratified summer and autumn months, when net acquisition exceeded modeled gross uptake. This shortfall indicates that the kelp forest received over half its nitrogen from sources other than nitrate such as ammonium from epibionts. Most of the nitrate in the forest was delivered as a result of upwelling-favorable winds and convection. Internal waves and local streams contributed {\textless}9{\%} of the nitrate delivered to the forest on an annual basis and 20{\%} during stratified periods. Kelp used less than 5{\%} of the nitrate supplied to the forest. Nitrate delivery to this modest sized kelp forest was roughly equivalent between alongshore (45{\%}) and cross-shore flows (55{\%}), which distinguishes it from large kelp forests in which cross-shore flows dominate exchange.},

abstract = {Understanding temporal variation at the scale of weeks to months is critical to understanding broad temporal patterns in diversity in the same way as understanding diversity across landscapes relies on understanding variation at the scale of meters. However, whereas small-scale spatial variation in temperate reef algal assemblages has been extensively studied, fine-scale temporal changes have not been well addressed. By sampling the macroalgae of a subtidal reef near Perth (Australia), dominated by the small kelp Ecklonia radiata, every 40 days over a 2-year period, we were able to test whether temporal changes in species richness, assemblage structure and species turn-over were related to seasonal changes in surface temperature, solar radiation and wave height. A total of 93 macroalgal taxa were identified, and species richness per sampling time ranged from 25 to 64 taxa 1.25 m-2. Biomass of E. radiata was positively correlated with changes in sea surface temperature and light, and negatively correlated with wave height. Species richness, assemblage structure and turn-over of other macroalgae were more associated with seasonal changes in kelp biomass than environmental variables per se. We conclude that seasonal changes in environmental conditions drive changes in the kelp canopy, which in turn drive changes in species richness and assemblage structure. This suggests that habitat-formers such as kelps can exert a strong temporal influence on associated communities, analogous to well-described spatial influences. Thus, as kelp canopy biomass expands and retracts over time-scales of weeks to months, so does available space for colonization and growth, resulting in a high species turn-over. Species richness is therefore increased and maintained through time, in the same way as canopy-gap mosaics increase and maintain species richness across spatial landscapes. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The formation of sea urchin 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However there has been much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to sea urchin barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult sea urchins experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where sea urchin predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) sea urchins was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range of sizes of sea urchins was exposed to three sizes of rock lobsters in a caging experiment, juvenile sea urchins were eaten more frequently than larger sea urchins by all sizes of rock lobster, but only the largest rock lobsters ({\textgreater} 120??mm CL) were able to consume large adult sea urchins. Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult sea urchins in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult sea urchins experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of sea urchins to rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, rock lobsters were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult sea urchins in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly rock lobsters, exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult sea urchins are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals. Fishing of rock lobsters is likely to reduce an important component of mortality in H. erythrogramma populations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Plants were grown in six light regimes: full sunlight (100{\%}), 50, 30, 20, 15, and 5{\%} of full light over a 2-month period. Measurements of growth, biomass, pigments, stable isotopes and leaf anatomy were made at the end of the experiment. Plants survived under all light treatments, even below minimum light requirements of related seagrasses. However, the experimental light levels possibly do not correspond to light reaching seagrass leaves under natural conditions. Plants grown under high light conditions (50-100{\%} light) had smaller shoots, higher biomass and productivity, less negative $\delta$13C values, lower leaf nitrogen content, less chlorophyll and more ultraviolet light absorbing pigment than plants grown under low light conditions ({\textless}20{\%} light). Photoadaptation by ultraviolet light absorbing pigment(s) was noted, with more variability in ultraviolet light pigments than in chlorophyll levels. Increased CO2demand and/or increased CO2recycling in internal gas spaces may account for the less negative $\delta$13C values in high light treatments, indicating less isotopic discrimination in seagrass leaves in high light. A saturation response of growth rates to light intensity was observed, with less substantial growth reductions at lower light intensities than observed in other seagrass shading experiments. Nutrient limitation in high light was inferred by a growth maximum at 50{\%} light level, increased root biomass and lower leaf nitrogen content in high light treatments. Overall, a wide range of morphological and physiological photoadaptive responses not previously reported in Zostera capricorni was observed. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Postelsia sporophytes are shown to colonize experimentally cleared spaces in beds of Mytilus with no concurrent colonization of adjacent uncleared controls. However, unlike many annual algae which have high spore dispersal abilities, Postelsia seems to have an effective distance of sporophyte colonization of only about 3 m from the edge of existing Postelsia patch. This limited spore dispersal is the mechanism postulated to explain the observed within-patch aggregated distribution also. Postelsia patches are maintained through time by settlement of Postelsia on other algal and animal species. By increasing the probability of both being ripped from the substraturm, and by overgrowing and smothering barnacles, Postelsia sporophytes clear primary substratum for the eventual use of sporophytes of their own species.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation in dispersal and recruitment of
the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica and
of filamentous brown algae (FBA) consisting primarily of
Ectocarpus siliculosus were examined off southern California,
USA. These three taxa of sublittoral brown algae show enormous
differences in adult morphology and demography, but release
propagules near the bottom that are similar in size, shape, and
motility. Their weekly variation in recruitment was measured on
replicate frosted glass slides placed at different distances from
stands of fertile adults at three sites. For all taxa,
significant temporal variation was observed in recruitment at the
zoospore source as well as at distances out to 4000 m from the
source. For the kelps, this variation was due to variable rates
of both zoospore settlement and early postsettlement mortality.
In general, recruitment density of both kelps rapidly declined
with distance from the adult stand; significantly lower
recruitment was observed at as little as 3 m away. In contrast,
dispersal of FBA was much greater; no significant decrease in
recruitment density was observed out to 500 m. The differences in
dispersal between these two algal groups may result from
behavioral differences of their zoospores. Unlike those of kelps,
zoospores of FBA are positively phototactic. This enables FBA
zoospores to remain in the water column longer, thus increasing
the distances over which they disperse. The predominant pattern
of limited dispersal in the two kelps, however, was not constant
over time. Dispersal was greatly expanded during episodic periods
of high recruitment that coincided with winter storms. Turbulent
water flow associated with these storms may resuspend kelp
zoospores normally occurring near the bottom and allow them to be
transported greater distances by prevailing currents. Although
species characteristics of the adult stand appeared to influence
the distribution of recruits, the effect disappeared within 10 m
of the stand. At a short-range study site, decreases in spatial
variation in recruitment density between the zoospore source and
3 and 10 m away indicated that the distribution of zoospores
became more uniform with distance. Likewise at a long-range site,
recruitment out to 4000 m appeared to occur uniformly and
coincided with recruitment at the zoospore source and at all
intermediate distances. This uniformity and coincidence of
recruitment indicated that dispersal over longer distances was
probably via individual zoospores rather than via clumps of
drifting plants or reproductive fragments as suggested in
previous studies. Although episodic, such dispersal is probably
essential in promoting the persistence of these plants in highly
dis- turbed and unpredictable environments.},

Differences in status and trends according to geographical areas, species identity and small-scale variations within the same habitat where shown by assembling and mapping kelp distribution and trend data. Significant data gaps for some geographical regions, like the Mediterranean and the southern Iberian Peninsula, were also identified. The data used for this study confirmed a general trend with decreasing abundance of some native kelp species at their southern distributional range limits and increasing abundance in other parts of their distribution (Saccharina latissima and Saccorhiza polyschides). The expansion of the introduced species Undaria pinnatifida was also registered. Drivers of observed changes in kelp forests distribution and abundance were assessed using experts' opinions. Multiple possible drivers were identified, including global warming, sea urchin grazing, harvesting, pollution and fishing pressure, and their impact varied between geographical areas. Overall, the results highlight major threats for these ecosystems but also opportunities for conservation. Major requirements to ensure adequate protection of coastal kelp ecosystems along European coastlines are discussed, based on the local to regional gaps detected in the study.},

abstract = {The photosynthetic responses of the south Pacific kelp Lessonia
nigrescens of the coast of Valdivia, Chile (40 S), were
investigated by exposing its different thallus parts, fronds,
stipes and holdfasts, to UV radiation in the laboratory.
Biologically effective doses (BEDphotoinhibition300) between 400
and 800 kJ m 2 were required for a 40{\%} inhibition in
photosynthesis under UVA+UVB radiation. At BEDphotoinhibition300
close to 250 kJ m 2 (in treatments without UVB), the inhibition
of photosynthesis did not exceed 20{\%}. These UV doses were in the
range of current daily doses measured in Valdivia on cloudless
summer days. In general, exposure to UVB for periods longer than
12 h reduced photosynthesis, measured as maximal quantum yield
(Fv/Fm) and electron transport. The fronds were the most
UV-sensitive section of this alga, coinciding with the highest
pigments contents and carbon fixation. Evidence of a photodamage
was also seen. After a 48 h exposure to PAR+UVA+UVB, a decrease
of Fv/Fm in the fronds was close to 41{\%}, while in the stipes and
holdfasts it was 12 and 18{\%}, respectively. Although the thalli
from the different size classes showed marked differences in
their morphology and morphometry, no obvious differences in the
UV tolerance of the fronds were detected. The results indicated
that the UV-related responses are integrated in the suite of
morpho-functional adaptations of the alga. Although the fronds
are spatially more exposed to solar radiation than basal
structures (stipes and holdfast), due their high turnover rate
they may compensate better detrimental effects of UV. In
contrast, stipes and the holdfast are key support structures
characterized by low replacement rates and designed to confer
hydrodynamic resistance to drag forces.},

Most available evidence is observational or correlative, with intrinsic risks of confounded causality. This paper reviews and categorises the available evidence, concluding that competition between corals and algae probably is widespread on coral reefs, but also that the interaction varies considerably. Widespread replacement of corals by algae may often indicate coral mortality due to external disturbances. rather than competitive overgrowth, but may lead to competitive inhibition of coral recruitment. with consequences for reef recovery. We list eight specific processes by which corals and algae may affect each other, and suggest life history properties that will influence which of these interactions are possible. We propose a matrix for algal effects on corals, which lists the subset of processes possible for each combination of coral life form and algal functional group. This table provides a preliminary framework for improved understanding and interpretation of coral-algal interactions.},

For example, endangered species laws and regulations and other conservation statutes typically fail to con- sider the interactions of strongly interacting species, probably because the importance of such interactions was not well understood when the laws were drafted. By failing to consider current knowledge, therefore, natural resource scientists and managers may be harming the species and systems they are charged with protecting.Most ecologists agree that the conservation of biodiversity is facilitated by maintaining population densities and distributions of strongly interactive species above estimable thresholds for ecological effectiveness. Assuming that conservation biologists and nat- ural resource managers are “physicians to nature,” we therefore propose they are obligated to adhere to a doctrine of “best conservation practices based on the best science,” applying a more rigorous standard for the management of relatively interactive species than may be mandated by older statutes and effected by current practice and convention.

Loss of structural complexity is linked to ecosystem declines in biodiversity and resilience. We developed new methods using underwater stereo-imagery spanning 4 years (2010–2013) to reconstruct 3D models of coral reef areas and quantified both structural complexity at two spatial resolutions (2.5 and 25 cm) and benthic community composition to characterize changes after an unprecedented thermal anomaly on the west coast of Australia in 2011. Structural complexity increased at both resolutions in quadrats (4 m2) that bleached, but not those that did not bleach. Changes in complexity were driven by species-specific responses to warming, highlighting the importance of identifying small-scale dynamics to disentangle ecological responses to disturbance. We demonstrate an effective, repeatable method for quantifying the relationship among community composition, structural complexity and ocean warming, improving predictions of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental change.},

abstract = {Quantitative relationships were established between the recruitment of sporophytes of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh, and various environmental variables. Artificial substrata were inoculated with M. pyrifera zoospores in the laboratory and outplanted to a set of field stations in the San Mateo, San Onofre, and Barn kelp forests in southern California. Measurements of temperature, irradiance, seston flux and nitrogen concentration were made concurrently with estimates of sporophyte recruitment during 39 outplants from September 1977 to August 1982. Temperature, irradiance, and seston flux were significantly correlated with the density of sporophytes recruited from the outplanted gametophytes. Recruitment of sporophytes at densities {\textgreater}50 sporophytes??cm-2 represents sporophyte production by approximately 0.1{\%} of the outplanted female gametophytes. This occurred only at temperatures below 16.3??C and irradiation levels above 0.4 E??m-2??day-1. We have defined these conditions as a "recruitment window" within which sporophytes can be produced under natural conditions. Sporophyte recruitment was enhanced by fertilizing gametophytes with nitrogen and phosphorus. However, the relative level of recruitment on the fertilized substrata, which were outplanted in the late summer when sea temperatures were above 16??C, was low compared to recruitment on unfertilized substrata outplanted when temperatures were below 16??C. The irradiance requirements for sporophyte recruitment as indicated by these field studies agree well with those derived in the laboratory. Temperature, on the other hand, was negatively correlated with recruitment in the field, but had little effect (at temperatures up to 20??C) in the laboratory. These results coupled with the nutrient enrichment data indicate that a factor correlated with temperature, such as nutrient levels, may be the most important in determining recruitment success. Our results suggest that large scale temporal patterns of recruitment of giant kelp in southern California are determined, in part, by the infrequent occurrences of recruitment windows. However, proper irradiance and temperature conditions are not the sole requisites for recruitment as evidenced by a lack of recruitment on our artificial substrata during some apparent window periods. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {Topographical wave exposure indices allow objective assessment of the degree of wave action at coastal sites. We present a grid-based method for rapidly calculating indices at fine spatial resolutions along whole coastlines, and evaluate the power of candidate indices in predicting composition of rocky shore communities. The method has 3 stages: (1) a grid is created from a vector-based digital coastline using geographical information systems (GIS) software; (2) for every coastal cell, wave fetch is determined as the distance to the nearest land cell in 16 angular sectors, using coarse-, medium- and fine-resolution searches of the surrounding cells up to a distance of 200 km; (3) wind energy (average wind speed and proportional occurrence) in each sector is calculated for nearby coastal sites. We calculated the average fetch in each sector (F) and the sum of products of fetch and wind energy (W). A total of 57 species were surveyed at 185 sites in west Scotland for determination of trends with wave indices. Average wave fetch with a 200 m scale grid explained {\textgreater}50{\%} of the variation in the first principal component of the species-sites abundance matrix, with shore extent explaining another 10{\%}. Incorporating wind data in the indices had a negligible effect on predictive power. Species diversity explained 61{\%} of the variance in the second principal component and declined from low to high pelagic primary productivity. Separating direct physical effects from biological effects, such as food supply or grazing could potentially help us better understand the processes structuring biological communities on rocky shores.},

abstract = {Seaweeds are ecologically important primary producers, competitors, and ecosystem engineers that play a central role in coastal habitats ranging from kelp forests to coral reefs. Although seaweeds are known to be vulnerable to physical and chemical changes in the marine environment, the impacts of ongoing and future anthropogenic climate change in seaweed-dominated ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe the ways in which changes in the environment directly affect seaweeds in terms of their physiology, growth, reproduction, and survival. We consider the extent to which seaweed species may be able to respond to these changes via adaptation or migration. We also examine the extensive reshuffling of communities that is occurring as the ecological balance between competing species changes, and as top-down control by herbivores becomes stronger or weaker. Finally, we delve into some of the ecosystem-level responses to these changes, including changes in primary productivity, diversity, and resilience. Although there are several key areas in which ecological insight is lacking, we suggest that reasonable climate-related hypotheses can be developed and tested based on current information. By strategically prioritizing research in the areas of complex environmental variation, multiple stressor effects, evolutionary adaptation, and population, community, and ecosystem-level responses, we can rapidly build upon our current understanding of seaweed biology and climate change ecology to more effectively conserve and manage coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {We explicitly quantified spatial and temporal patterns in the
body temperature of an ecologically important species of
intertidal invertebrate, the mussel Mytilus californianus, along
the majority of its latitudinal range from Washington to
southern California, USA. Using long-term (five years),
high-frequency temperature records recorded at multiple sites,
we tested the hypothesis that local ?modifying factors? such as
the timing of low tide in summer can lead to large-scale
geographic mosaics of body temperature. Our results show that
patterns of body temperature during aerial exposure at low tide
vary in physiologically meaningful and often counterintuitive
ways over large sections of this species' geographic range. We
evaluated the spatial correlations among sites to explore how
body temperatures change along the latitudinal gradient, and
these analyses show that ?hot spots? and ?cold spots? exist
where temperatures are hotter or colder than expected based on
latitude. We identified four major hot spots and four cold spots
along the entire geographic gradient with at least one hot spot
and one cold spot in each of the three regions examined
(Washington?Oregon, Central California, and Southern
California). Temporal autocorrelation analysis of year-to-year
consistency and temporal predictability in the mussel body
temperatures revealed that southern animals experience higher
levels of predictability in thermal signals than northern
animals. We also explored the role of wave splash at a subset of
sites and found that, while average daily temperature extremes
varied between sites with different levels of wave splash,
yearly extreme temperatures were often similar, as were patterns
of predictability. Our results suggest that regional patterns of
tidal regime and local pattern of wave splash can overwhelm
those of large-scale climate in driving patterns of body
temperature, leading to complex thermal mosaics of temperature
rather than simple latitudinal gradients. A narrow focus on
population changes only at range margins may overlook
climatically forced local extinctions and other population
changes at sites well within a species range. Our results
emphasize the importance of quantitatively examining
biogeographic patterns in environmental variables at scales
relevant to organisms, and in forecasting the impacts of changes
in climate across species ranges.},

Nevertheless, little is known about many aspects of their biology, particularly their development. Given their phylogenetic distance (1.6 billion years) from other plant organisms (land plants, and green and red algae), brown algae harbor a high, as-yet undiscovered diversity of biological mechanisms governing their development. They also show great morphological plasticity, responding to specific environmental constraints, such as sea currents, reduced light availability, grazer attacks, desiccation and UV exposure. Here, we show that brown algal morphogenesis is rather simple and flexible, and review recent genomic data on the cellular and molecular mechanisms known to date that can possibly account for this developmental strategy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

experiments. NY plants survived and grew for 6 wk at 20°C. ME
plants showed negative growth during wk 2 and 100{\%} mortality

June to September, 1985, also exhibited differential
survivorship when ambient temperatures exceeded 20°C. Results of
photosynthesis and dark respiration measurements on NY and ME
plants grown at various temperatures suggested that the
high-temperature tolerance of NY plants was attributable to
their ability to maintain positive daily net C-fixation at 20°C.
The high-temperature tolerance of the NY plants appeared to be
due to genetic adaptation and is probably crucial to the

1-m2 quadrates, haphazardly placed in dense assemblages at 6?9 m
depth in Tei, Tosa Bay (southern Japan; water temperature
15?29°C) from 1995 to 1996, and in Nabeta Bay, Shimoda (central
Japan; water temperature 13?25°C) from 1996 to 1997. Growth
rings were checked for all samples and mean values of each
biometric parameter of sporophytes 1-year-old and over were
compared. The plant length (stipe length + primary blade length)
was always shorter in Tei sporophytes (24?52 cm) than Nabeta
sporophytes (70?100 cm), the difference being mainly owing to
the shorter stipe length in Tei sporophytes (7?14 cm) than in
Nabeta sporophytes (54?83 cm). However, the primary blade length
was sometimes longer in Tei sporophytes (12?38 cm) than in
Nabeta sporophytes (14?21 cm). Stipe diameter, longest bladelet
length and primary blade width were mostly less in Tei
sporophytes (8.6?12.4 mm, 5.5?7.0 cm and 23.4?38.0 cm,
respectively) than Nabeta sporophytes (16.4?20.2 mm, 9.2?12.0 cm

bladelets of sporophytes from Tei (15?28) and Nabeta (18?29)
were within the same range. At Tei, 32?43{\%} of the sporophytes
had wrinkled blades in summer and autumn, whereas wrinkled
primary blades or bladelets were not observed in Nabeta
sporophytes throughout the experimental period. These
morphometric differences of E. cava between the two localities
are suggested to be dependent on environmental factors,

abstract = {Floating objects are suggested to be the principal vector for
the transport and dispersal of marine invertebrates with direct
development as well as catalysts for carbon and nutrient
recycling in accumulation areas. The first step in identifying
the ecological relevance of floating objects in a specific area
is to identify their spatio-temporal distribution. We evaluated
the composition, abundance, distribution, and temporal
variability of floating objects along the continental coast of
central–southern Chile (33–42°S) and the Patagonian fjords
(42–50°S) using ship surveys conducted in austral winter
(July/August) and spring (November) of the years 2002–2005 and
2008. Potential sources of floating items were identified with
the aid of publicly available databases and scientific reports.
We found three main types of floating objects, namely floating
marine debris (mainly plastic objects and Styrofoam), wood
(trunks and branches), and floating kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera
and Durvillaea antarctica). Floating marine debris were abundant
along most of the examined transects, with markedly lower
abundances toward the southern fjord areas. Floating marine
debris abundances generally corresponded to the distribution of
human activities, and were highest in the Interior Sea of
Chilo{\'{e}}, where aquaculture activities are intense. Floating wood
appeared sporadically in the study area, often close to the main
rivers. In accordance with seasonal river run-off, wood was more
abundant along the continental coast in winter (rainy season)
and in the Patagonian fjords during the spring surveys (snow
melt). Densities of the two floating kelp species were similar
along the continental coast, without a clear seasonal pattern.
M. pyrifera densities increased towards the south, peaking in
the Patagonian fjords, where it was dominant over D. antarctica.
Densities of M. pyrifera in the Patagonian fjords were highest
in spring. Correlation analyses between the abundances of
floating objects and the distance to the nearest sources were
generally non-significant, suggesting that post-supply processes
affect the distribution of the floating objects in the study
region. The identification of several major retention zones
supports this idea. Accumulation areas of floating objects
appear to be more common in the fjord zones. In general, the
results underscore the abundance of floating objects throughout
the study region and the fact that floating marine debris
sources are mostly local, whereas floating algae may be
dispersed over greater distances. Future studies should focus on
the ecological role of floating objects in biota dispersal and
nutrient cycling.},

abstract = {The distribution of young sporophytes (up to 0.25 m stipe length) of the kelp Ecklonia maxima, on various substrata, at depths of 2.5 to 5.0 m, was studied at 8 sites on the southwest coast of South Africa. The most common substratum available was rock (bare or covered with encrusting coralline algae), followed by kelp holdfasts, and the ascidian Pyura stolonifera at some sites. A disproportionately high ratio (relative to the available substrata) of young sporophytes grew on the holdfasts of mature kelps at most sites, but particularly where high densities of benthic invertebrate grazers were present (mainly the urchin Parechinus angulosus, also abalone Haliotis midae, limpets Patella spp, and gastropods Turbo spp, and Oxystele spp.). Jacobs' index of electivity was used an indicator of 'preference for' (interpreted as indicating survival on) the substratum type. This showed a statistically significant 'negative selection' of rock as a substratum at sites where grazers were numerous. The ratios of young sporophytes on holdfasts/young sporophytes on rock were directly proportional to grazer densities when sites were compared (r = -0.90, p = 0.002); supporting the hypothesis that mature holdfasts are an important refuge for recruitment of E. maxima sporophytes. There was an inverse relationship between percentage cover of understorey algae and grazer densities (r = 0.92, p = 0.001). In general, sites east of Cape Point (west coast/south coast transition zone) have far more grazers and reduced understorey algal biomasses compared to west coast sites. There thus appear to be fundamental differences in some of the major ecological processes in kelp beds in these 2 areas, with important implications for commercial kelp harvesting.},

that formed extensive covers where canopies were absent.
Moreover, articulated corallines occurred in greater abundance
beneath canopies of E. radiata mixed with canopy-forming species
of Fucales than beneath monospecific canopies of E. radiata. We
experimentally tested the hypotheses that (1) canopies negatively
affect the abundance of articulated corallines and filamentous
turfs, (2) physical abrasion of the substratum by canopies
contributes to such negative effects, and (3) the effect of
abrasion on articulated corallines is greater beneath
monospecific canopies than mixed-species canopies, but the effect
on filamentous turfs does not differ between types of canopy.
Experiments revealed large negative effects of canopies on the
abundance of articulated corallines and filamentous turfs, to
which abrasion made a substantial contribution ({\~{}}54 to 67{\%} for
articulated coralline and {\~{}}58{\%} for filamentous turf). Moreover,
the intensity of abrasion was greater beneath monospecific than
mixed-species canopies, which was consistent with differences in
the effect of canopies and abrasion on articulated corallines
(monospecific {\textgreater} mixed-species) but not filamentous turfs
(monospecific = mixed-species). Although abrasion is one of many
possible influences of algal canopies, our results show that it
can substantially contribute to the heterogeneity of understorey

suggests that the effects of E. radiata canopies on understorey

likely explanation. The rate of accumulation of species of
invertebrates to the holdfast is fast in small holdfasts, very
slow in larger holdfasts, and the pioneer species are also found
in larger and older holdfasts. Thus, the dynamic of species turn

abstract = {Many seaweed species (primary rafters) float at the sea surface
and travel with marine currents after detachment from benthic
habitats. Various studies have confirmed that dispersal via
floating sporophytes and/or gametophytes influences the
phylogeography and genetic population structure of these buoyant
seaweeds. In addition, non-buoyant seaweeds (secondary rafters)
that grow attached to or intermingled with these primary
floaters may also become dispersed by rafting on their floating
hosts. Here, we examine reports of non-buoyant seaweed species
associated with buoyant seaweeds and discuss potential
consequences for their phylogeography and/or genetic population
structure. We found that mostly red and brown algae have been
reported with floating seaweed rafts, most of them growing as
epiphytes and some as obligate parasites (e.g. endophytes) that
travel with their hosts. Molecular evidence suggests dispersal
associated with primary floaters in 16 non-buoyant seaweeds,
although colonization of distant sites could also have occurred
via other floating substrata such as wood, buoys, and other
man-made materials. Transoceanic dispersal has been inferred for
non-buoyant seaweeds (for example, Gracilaria chilensis and
Capreolia implexa) based on low levels of genetic structure and
shared haplotypes among populations separated over vast
distances of open ocean (e.g. New Zealand–Chile). Some
non-buoyant species suspected or shown to be dispersed by
rafting are from intertidal habitats, and these algae can resist
physiologically stressful conditions during long trips at the
sea surface. However, subtidal and low intertidal non-buoyant
species have higher potential to be transported because they
cohabit with common raft-forming kelps, often growing on them as
epiphytes. We conclude that buoyant seaweeds play an important
role in driving the phylogeography, evolution, connectivity and
distribution of non-buoyant associated seaweeds. Dispersal of
non-buoyant seaweeds via these floating seaweeds may have been
underestimated in the past.},

abstract = {The mobile fauna associated with two sympatric kelp species with different holdfast morphology (Saccorhiza polyschides and Laminaria hyperborea) was compared to test for differences in the assemblage structure of holdfast-associated mobile epifauna. A total of 24,140 epifaunal individuals were counted from 30 holdfasts of each kelp species. Overall epifaunal abundances exceeded faunal abundances previously reported from holdfasts of other kelps. Three taxonomic groups, Amphipoda, Mollusca, and Polychaeta, accounted for ca. 85{\%} of all individuals. Total abundances increased with the amount of habitat available, quantified either as the volume or the area provided by the holdfasts. The multivariate structure of the epifaunal assemblage did not differ between holdfasts of the two kelp species. However, epifaunal assemblages responded differentially to the habitat attributes provided by each type of kelp holdfast: multivariate variation in the assemblage structure of epifauna was mostly explained by holdfast area and volume for L. hyperborea, and by the surface-to-volume ratio for S. polyschides holdfasts. Therefore, the physical attributes of biogenic habitats, here kelp holdfasts that better predict patterns in the assemblage structure of associated fauna can differ according to their different physical morphology, even though the overall assemblage structure of associated fauna was similar.},

In subtidal marine ecosystems, however, inter- actions along physical stress gradients have seldom been tested. We observed seaweed canopy interactions across depth and latitudinal gradients to test whether light and temperature stress structured interaction patterns. We also quantified interspecific and intraspecific interactions among nine subtidal canopy seaweed species across three continents to examine the general nature of interactions in subtidal systems under low consumer pressure. We reveal that positive and neu- tral interactions are widespread throughout global seaweed communities and the nature of interac- tions can change from competitive to facilitative with increasing light stress in shallow marine systems. These findings provide support for the stress gradient hypothesis within subtidal seaweed communities and highlight the importance of canopy interactions for the maintenance of subtidal marine habitats experiencing environmental stress.},

abstract = {In conditions of low water motion ({\textless} 0.06 m s - 1), the
availability of essential nutrients to macroalgae, and thus their
potential productivity, may be limited by thick diffusion
boundary-layers at the thallus surface. The ability of macroalgae
to take up nutrients in slow moving water may be related to how
their blade morphology affects diffusion boundary- layer
thickness. For the giant kelp, Macrocystis integ- rifolia Bory,
morphological measurements indicate that blades of plants from a
site exposed to wave action are thick, narrow and have a heavily
corrugated surface. In contrast, blades from a site with a low
degree of water motion are relatively thin, with few surface
corruga- tions and large undulations along their edges. The aim
of our work was to test the hypothesis that mor- phological
features of M. integrifolia blades from a shel- tered site allow
enhanced inorganic nitrogen uptake at low seawater velocities
compared to blades with a wave-exposed morphology. The rate of
nitrate and ammonium uptake by morphologically distinct blades of
M. integrifoIia, from sites that were sheltered from and exposed
to wave action, were measured in the laboratory at a range of
seawater velocities (0.01 to 0.16 m s-1), between March and May

rate) and Uo.37 (the velocity at which the uptake rate is 37{\%} of

formula. These parameters were sim- ilar for both blade
morphologies, at all seawater ve- locities tested. Additional
measurements suggest that the nitrogen status of M. integrifolia
blades from wave- sheltered and exposed sites were similar
throughout the experimental period, and thus nitrogen status did
not affect the rate of nitrogen uptake in these experiments. On
the basis of these results, we conclude that blade morphology
does not enhance nitrogen uptake by M. integrifoIia in conditions

increased dramatically in central Norway since the 1990s, and
predation by C. pagurus may contribute to the decline in sea

an alga. In contrast, intertidal macroalgae may experience more
than 8000 waves a day. This repeated loading can cause cracks -
introduced, for example, by herbivory or abrasion - to grow and
eventually cause breakage, yet fatigue crack growth has not
previously been taken into account. Here, we present methods
from the engineering field of fracture mechanics that can be
used to assess consequences of repeated force imposition for
seaweeds. These techniques allow quantification of crack growth
in wave-swept macroalgae, a first step towards considering
macroalgal breakage in the realistic context of repeated force
imposition. These analyses can also be applied to many other

abstract = {Effective dispersal is problematic for benthic organisms without
planktonic larvae; rafting and vertical migrations are
mechanisms that can potentially be employed by such fauna, but
these strategies entail considerable predation risk as well as
other disadvantages. Unattached, but non-floating, ``drift''
algae harbor large numbers of fauna and may serve as an
alternative dispersal mechanism in some systems. This paper
reports field manipulations in Florida Bay, Florida, USA
designed to determine (1) if such algae can disperse benthic
animals, and (2) if dispersal efficiency varies as a function of
two common substrata types: seagrass and bare sediment. A live
immersion stain was used to mark faunal associates of Laurencia
spp. algal clumps in situ. The fidelity of molluscs, decapods,
ophiuroids, and fishes to stationary algal clumps was then
compared with the fidelity of these animals to clumps that were
forced to tumble over a given distance with a blower apparatus;
these experiments were performed over both sand and seagrass
substrata. Measurements of frequency, spatial extent, and rate
of algal drift were made to aid in assessing the potential
importance of benthic algae as a dispersal mechanism. Algal
clumps often rolled in a manner similar to that of terrestrial
tumbleweeds; mark-recapture work showed that algal clumps can
move up to 0.5 km/day and that algal drift is a frequent
phenomenon. The algal masses were effective transporters of
benthic fauna, including mobile shrimps and fishes; dispersal
was more efficient over sand than over seagrass. Dispersal of
fauna via this mobile habitat should entail lower risk than
other adult dispersal stratagems such as vertical migration or
rafting; this mechanism would be most advantageous for brooding
species or those with limited planktonic phases. Differential
fidelity to clumps tumbling across seagrass versus sand suggests
that the algae could facilitate exchange of fauna between
isolated seagrass patches.},

In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to 'barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs.},

abstract = {A regime shift is considered to be a sudden shift in structure
and functioning of a marine ecosystem, affecting several living
components and resulting in an alternate state. According to this
definition, regime shifts differ from species replacement or
alternation of species at similar trophic levels, whereby the
ecosystem is not necessarily significantly altered in terms of
its structure and function; only its species composition changes.
This paper provides an overview of regime shifts, species
replacements and alternations that have been observed in the
northern and southern Benguela ecosystems over the past few
decades. Bottom-up control, initiating and sustaining regime
shifts or species replacements via environmental forcing, is
documented for both the southern and the northern Benguela
ecosystems. Fishing (a case of top-down control) appears to have
played an important role in regime shift processes in the
Namibian ecosystem. Very low biomass levels of exploited fish
stocks associated with less efficient energy transfer in the
northern Benguela are indicative of a regime shift. Very high
biomass levels have been reached in the southern Benguela in the
2000s. However the alternation between sardine and anchovy that
has been observed in the southern Benguela over the last two
decades appears not to have had major effects on the overall
functioning of the ecosystem. The consequences of regime shifts
for exploitation are highlighted, suggesting that fisheries
managers should move towards a more effective ecosystem approach
to fisheries. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

a three-dimensional baroclinic circulation model developed for
massively parallel computers (the Proudman Oceanographic
Laboratory Coastal–Ocean Modelling System) and a sophisticated

model, we simulate the period of the North Sea Project (August
1988 to October 1989) and attempt as comprehensive an
examination of model uncertainties as the available data
permits. We are able to make some degree of assessment for all
aspects of the physics model, apart from the turbulence closure
scheme, and use a simple cost function to systematically compare
the accuracy of different variables. We find some aspects
(notably tidal currents and elevation, and sea surface
temperature) are well modelled, with RMS errors less than 0.4
standard deviations of the data, whereas some aspects (e.g.
residual current speed and salinity) have RMS errors similar to
the standard deviation of the data. Improving the residual
currents and salinity comparison requires improving several
aspects of both the model (forcing and formulation) and
observational data (quantity and quality). In addition to
directing improvements in the model, this exercise also suggests
where data assimilation effort might prove most fruitful. We
also demonstrate that this resolution is sufficient to model

Distribution maps of biological species were considered in terms of the same two temperatures, recorded at a subset N, of the meteorological stations representing the total world distributions of each particular species. 3. When y was plotted against x, the scatters so obtained for 35 species, had Major Principal Axes inclined at angles in the range tan- -0.02 to tan' 0.85 relative to the x-axis. 4. Subelliptical confidence regions, representing a measure of the temperature distri- bution for each species, were constructed about calculated points on the Major and Minor Principal Axes. 5. These subelliptical confidence regions in turn permitted the representation, on a geographical map, of that part of the total world area in which temperatures would be suitable for each species. 6. The technique is applicable wherever detailed knowledge of the effective tempera- ture limits for a biological species are required-whether in agricultural planning, the interpretation of the consequences of climate change, or the estimates of past tempera- tures at fossil sites.

abstract = {Long-term ecological data sets present opportunities for identifying drivers of community dynamics and quantifying their effects through time series analysis. Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are well known in many other disciplines, such as econometrics, but widespread adoption of MAR methods in ecology and natural resource management has been much slower despite some widely cited ecological examples. Here we review previous ecological applications of MAR models and highlight their ability to identify abiotic and biotic drivers of population dynamics, as well as community-level stability metrics, from long- term empirical observations. Thus far, MAR models have been used mainly with data from freshwater plankton communities; we examine the obstacles that may be hindering adoption in other systems and suggest practical modifications that will improve MAR models for broader application. Many of these modifications are already well known in other fields in whichMAR models are common, although they are frequently described under different names. In an effort to make MAR models more accessible to ecologists, we include a worked example using recently developed R packages (MAR1 and MARSS), freely available and open-access software.},

the dune troughs by dune progression kills the weed, leaving the

We compared the performance of these two methods on data that were generated by a computer simulation program that assumed the infinite sites model of mutation and that assumed an island model of migration. We found that in general when there is no recombination, the cladistic method performed better than FST while the reverse was true for rates of recombination similar to those found in eukaryotic nuclear genes, although FST performed better for all recombination rates for very low levels of migration (Nm = 0.1).},

abstract = {In this article, a collaborative effort between archaeologists
and marine ecologists, we discuss the role kelp forest ecosystems
may have played in facilitating the movement of maritime peoples
from Asia to the Americas near the end of the Pleistocene.
Growing in cool nearshore waters along rocky coastlines, kelp
forests offer some of the most productive habitats on earth, with
high primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, and
three-dimensional habitat supporting a diverse array of marine
organisms. Today, extensive kelp forests are found around the
North Pacific from Japan to Baja California. After a break in the
tropics—where nearshore mangrove forests and coral reefs are
highly productive—kelp forests are also found along the Andean
Coast of South America. These Pacific Rim kelp forests support or
shelter a wealth of shellfish, fish, marine mammals, seabirds,
and seaweeds, resources heavily used historically by coastal
peoples. By about 16,000 years ago, the North Pacific Coast
offered a linear migration route, essentially unobstructed and
entirely at sea level, from northeast Asia into the Americas.
Recent reconstructions suggest that rising sea levels early in
the postglacial created a highly convoluted and island-rich coast
along Beringia's southern shore, conditions highly favorable to
maritime hunter-gatherers. Along with the terrestrial resources
available in adjacent landscapes, kelp forests and other
nearshore habitats sheltered similar suites of food resources
that required minimal adaptive adjustments for migrating coastal
peoples. With reduced wave energy, holdfasts for boats, and
productive fishing, these linear kelp forest ecosystems may have
provided a kind of ``kelp highway'' for early maritime peoples
colonizing the New World.},

origin discarded at sea, or reaching the sea through waterways.
The effect of marine debris on wildlife, tourism and human
health is well documented and there is considerable scientific
literature about plastic litter in the sea and over the seabed,
mostly highlighting the possible impact on marine mammals and
tourism. Dispersal of marine and terrestrial organisms on
floating objects has biogeographical and ecological interest.
For some species, extension of their geographical range is more
likely to be related to transport of mature individuals on
floating rafts than to the active or passive dispersal of
reproductive propagules. Variability and variety of rafting
materials has increased dramatically in recent years and marine
litter has been used widely as a raft by `hitch-hiking' species.
This paper reports on the benthic invertebrates living on marine
debris transported by wind and surface currents over the western
Mediterranean Sea. Plastics accounted for the major item of
debris because of poor degradability, however glass, cans,
fishing nets and polyurethane containers, were also found.
Macro-benthos living on raft material comprised mainly molluscs,
polychaetes and bryozoans. Large fish were found commonly below
large plastic bags. Estimations of the distances that may be
covered by hitch-hiking species and the contribution of rafting
to the theoretical dispersal of species is provided.},

abstract = {The genetic consequences of living on the edge of distributional
ranges have been the subject of a largely unresolved debate.
Populations occurring along persistent low latitude ranges
(rear-edge) are expected to retain high and unique genetic
diversity. In contrast, currently less favourable environmental
conditions limiting population size at such range-edges may have
caused genetic erosion that prevails over past historical
effects, with potential consequences on reducing future adaptive
capacity. The present study provides an empirical test of whether
population declines towards a peripheral range might be reflected
on decreasing diversity and increasing population isolation and
differentiation. We compare population genetic differentiation
and diversity with trends in abundance along a latitudinal
gradient towards the peripheral distribution range of Saccorhiza
polyschides, a large brown seaweed that is the main structural
species of kelp forests in SW Europe. Signatures of recent
bottleneck events were also evaluated to determine whether the
recently recorded distributional shifts had a negative influence
on effective population size. Our findings show decreasing
population density and increasing spatial fragmentation and local
extinctions towards the southern edge. Genetic data revealed two
well supported groups with a central contact zone. As predicted,
higher differentiation and signs of bottlenecks were found at the
southern edge region. However, a decrease in genetic diversity
associated with this pattern was not verified. Surprisingly,
genetic diversity increased towards the edge despite bottlenecks
and much lower densities, suggesting that extinctions and
recolonizations have not strongly reduced diversity or that
diversity might have been even higher there in the past, a
process of shifting genetic baselines.},

@article{Holderegger2006-fk,
abstract = {In their inaugural paper, Manel et al. (2003) defined landscape
genetics as a combination of landscape ecology and population
genetics. In more detail, these authors stated that landscape
genetics `aims at providing information about the interaction
between landscape features and microevolutionary processes, such
as gene flow, genetic drift and selection' (Manel et al. 2003,
p. 189). The first lesson to learn from this is that we are
dealing with microevolution, i.e., evolutionary processes within
species. Second, we are talking about gene flow and selection,
two ecological and evolutionary processes that need different
genetic approaches to be investigated Holderegger et al. 2006).
Third, Manel et al. (2003, p. 190) remarked that `the two key
steps of landscape genetics are the detection of genetic
discontinuities and the correlation of these discontinuities
with landscape environmental features, such as barriers', which
provides relevant information for various scientific disciplines
such as evolution, ecology or conservation biology. Hence, we
need two data sets, a genetic one and a landscape ecological
one, and we look for breaks, gradients or transitions that
coincide in these two data sets. Manel et al. (2003) were less
explicit in their landscape definition, and landscape ecologists
are well aware that this is a difficult task (Turner et al.
2001). Thus, the definition of landscape genetics by Manel et
al. (2003) was much clearer on the population genetic than on
the landscape ecological side, including spatial scale. A
pragmatic circumscription of landscape genetics could be that
landscape genetics endorses those studies that combine
population genetic data, adaptive or neutral, with data on
landscape composition and configuration, including matrix
quality. A comparison with metapopulation biology and
metapopulation genetics may clarify the major characteristic of
landscape genetics. Classical metapopulation studies are
spatially implicit, they view the natural world as divided into
cheerful islands (patches) and hostile sea (matrix) (Baquette
2004). Spatially realistic metapopulation models typically
consider the geographic distance between patches (Ovaskainen and
Hanski 2004), but do not include matrix quality. In landscape
genetics, however, the landscape with its composition, spatial
configuration and dynamics makes up half of the story beside
genetics. Landscape genetics therefore is much closer to the
real world than the classical metapopulation concept. For
instance, the actual connectivity of populations in terms of
dispersal of organisms may deviate markedly from an abstract
population genetic gene flow index (Whitlock and McCauley 1999)
or from a landscape ecological connectivity index calculated
from a habitat map (Li and Wu 2004). Landscape genetics provides
powerful tools for quantifying such processes in real
landscapes. While population geneticists have eagerly adopted
this approach, landscape ecologists have only started using
genetic methods. Landscape genetics is an important emerging
research topic that integrates landscape pattern with population
genetics. It is a new way of sci- Landscape Ecology (2006)

thinking, whereas there exists neither a specific landscape
genetic theory nor specific concepts. While landscape ecology
partly shares these limitations (Wu and Hobbs 2002), the
situation is different with population genetics, which has a
well-founded theoretical basis (Hartl and Clark 1997). However,
no landscape genetic research agenda has been defined to date,
and landscape genetic data are still scarce. We believe that the
benefit of landscape genetics lies in its heuristic, as well as
practical, values of forcing landscape ecologists to think more
about processes rather than spatial patterns, and to remind
population geneticists that processes are affected by the
quality of a landscape and not just by pure spatial distance
(Holderegger et al. in press). This is new, especially when it
comes to scientific practice.},

years in a southern New Zealand fjord characterized by strong

sites, although population productivity was greater at the outer
sites due to population density being 5-fold greater than at the
inner site. It was expected that the inner site would have no
pronounced seasonal pattern in growth and productivity due to its
homogeneity; however, all three sites displayed maximum rates in
late winter/spring and minimal in autumn. Growth rates were
2-fold greater during the first growth period than the following

a result of an interaction between light and temperature, and the
photosynthetic capability of E. radiata. Variable pigment content

differences were observed between sites, with E. radiata from the
inner site having longer, wider, thinner blades and longer

abstract = {Southern Africa supports a rich marine biota of 12 734 currently
described marine species. Although the distribution and overall
species-richness patterns of several component taxa are well
documented, studies considering range sizes are absent. This
study considers range size frequencies and distribution patterns
of seven major marine invertebrate taxa. The most commonly
observed pattern of size frequency distributions is bimodal, with
a predominance of species with either small or large range sizes,
and few taxa with intermediate-sized ranges. This pattern is
displayed by prosobranch and opisthobranch molluscs, polychaetes
and amphipods, and for all invertebrate taxa examined combined.
Peaks in small range sizes are likely a reflection of the
numerous poorly sampled and/or endemic species in the region,
while the high number of species with large range sizes can be
attributed to the large proportion of widespread tropical
Indo-Pacific species within the regional fauna. Overall, the
largest peaks of range-restricted endemic species occurred around
False Bay, Port Elizabeth, Durban, St Lucia and Maputo Bay. These
areas are all situated at or adjacent to recognised biogeographic
breaks for invertebrate assemblages, but coincidentally also tend
to also be areas of enhanced research and shipping activity. The
Cape Point region supports the highest number of endemics, with
73 species restricted to ranges of {\textless}100 km and 28 species to
ranges {\textless}200 km.},

diversity were found for only seven species and reflect
differences in effective population sizes. In addition, we
focused on the Brittany populations of Laminaria digitata, one of

abstract = {The transformation of random wave heights during shoaling, including waves breaking in the surf zone, was measured with an extensive array of instruments in the field. The initially Rayleigh height distributions in 10-m depth were observed to be modified by shoaling and breaking into new distributions which are again nearly Rayleigh but with some energy loss. Using locally measured Hrms, the Rayleigh distribution describes the measured central moments of H1/3 and H1/10 with average errors of ?0.2{\%} and ?1.8{\%}, respectively. The Rayleigh distribution is used to describe the random nature of wave heights in a single-parameter transformation model based on energy flux balance. The energy losses associated with wave breaking are parameterized using observed breaking wave distributions coupled with a periodic bore dissipation model. Using incident waves measured in 10-m depth as input conditions, the model predicts Hrms at shoreward locations within a rms error of ±9{\%}. The single free parameter of the model, a constant B representing the fraction of foam on the face of a wave, was chosen to best fit the data. The resulting large value of B implies that the simple periodic bore dissipation function substantially underestimates the actual dissipation.},

the model, parameterization of friction was modified to reflect
the patterns of culture configuration in the bay and the results
compared with the default case with no culture. Results of model
output indicate that suspended aquaculture results in a 20{\%}
reduction in current speed in the main navigation channel and a

channel, reduced flow had little effect on tracer exchange under
mid-ebb conditions, but the presence of culture structure caused
a 41{\%} decrease in exchange rate compared with the absence of
culture. These results indicate that disregard for physical
barriers associated with culture will result in a serious over
estimation of the particle renewal term and thus an
overestimation of carrying capacity. Further work is required to
measure the characteristics of culture (spacing, length scale),

abstract = {Waves out at sea, though usually forming a complex pattern, have
essentially the same characteristics over large distances. Upon
entering shallow water, these waves are transformed under the
influence of bottom features, and such transformations may be so
marked that breaker heights may vary greatly over short
distances along the shore. The effect of bottom features upon
waves can largely be interpreted in terms of a simple physical
process-wave refraction. In turn, wave refraction may be
responsible for alteration of the bottom features by
accumulation or removal of sediments and, in this manner, be an
important factor in beach erosion. In this report the role of
wave refraction is first reviewed in the light of other
processes affecting the transformation of waves in shallow
water. The mechanism of refraction is illustrated by means of a
few idealized examples, such as the refraction pattern along a
straight uniformly sloping beach, over a submarine canyon and
ridge, and around a headland. Next it is shown that extreme
variations in breaker height along the beach north of La Jolla,
California, can be computed for typical swell conditions, taking
the complex local bottom topography and the orientation of the
coastline into consideration. These changes are computed from
refraction diagrams for typical swell conditions, and they
compare favorably with observed changes in wave height, thus
indicating that wave refraction is the primary mechanism
controlling changes in wave height along a beach, and that
friction, diffraction, and other processes can be of secondary
importance only. Finally, it is noted that the transportation of
sediments is dependent upon longshore currents, rip currents,
and horizontal diffusion and that all these factors are greatly
influenced by the existing refraction pattern.},

abstract = {We examined the invertebrate assemblages associated with macroalgal canopies in the Mingan Islands (northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, eastern Canada) in the summer and fall of 2001. Invertebrates were sampled in patches or beds of 4 species of macroalgae (Alaria esculenta, Agarum cribrosum, Desmarestia viridis and Ptilota serrata) as well as in adjacent urchin barrens. Multivariate analyses of the invertebrates on the algal fronds, those on the underlying substratum, and the 2 groups together demonstrated differences in invertebrate assemblages among all 5 habitats. A. esculenta sheltered the most distinct invertebrate community due to the domination of the substratum under this alga by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Differences among other canopy types were due to differences in invertebrate assemblages both on the algal fronds and on the substratum. A manipulative experiment involving the removal of the canopy of the 2 most abundant macroalgae, A. esculenta and A. cribrosum, was carried out to examine their effects on mussels. Recruitment of mussels onto ceramic tiles varied among treatments and was greatest in the A. esculenta zone with greater, but non-significant, recruitment under the canopy. The growth of mussels from early July to October was higher in the A. cribrosum zone than the A. esculenta zone. However, there was no effect of the algal canopy in either zone. Our study demonstrates that the local diversity and distribution of benthic invertebrates is intimately associated with macroalgae, and reinforces the need for detailed sampling and analyses for assessing distributional patterns.},

abstract = {Sea-palms Postelsia palmaeformis Ruprecht are annual brown algae
that grow on wave-swept rocky shores, often forming dense stands.
Unlike most macroalgae, Postelsia stands upright in air-like
trees. The stipe flexibility that permits Postelsia to withstand
waves is provided by the low elastic modulus (5-10 MPa) of stipe
tissue; in spite of the weakness (low breaking stress, ≈ 1 MPa)
of this tissue, a large amount of energy (≈ 100 kJ/m3) is
required to break a stipe because they can be extended by 20-25{\%}
before breaking. Although made of such easily deformed tissue,
Postelsia can stand upright in air due to the width (high second
moment of area) and resilience of their stipes, but the
brittleness (low work of fracture, 400-900 J/m2) that accompanies
this resilience renders them susceptible to breakage if they
sustain deep scratches. Although wave-induced stresses
experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than
those experienced by isolated sea-palms, photon flux densities of
photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are
less than 10{\%} of those above Postelsia canopies. A number of
morphological features differ between canopy, understory, and
isolated individuals. Canopy plants in dense aggregations are
taller than isolated individuals and may exceed limiting
proportions for elastic stability. Postelsia shows photosynthetic
characteristics of ``shade-adapted'' plants, understory
individuals being especially effective at using low light.
Despite this, blade growth rates of understory plants are lower
than those of either canopy or isolated individuals. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Settlement of the mytilid, Choromytilus chorus, in the Marine Reserve of Mehuin, Chile, occurs on three different types of filamentous structures: (1) the filamentous alga Gymnogongrus furcellatus; (2) the byssus of adult Choromytilus; and (3) the byssus of the small mytilid Semimytilus algosus. Observations made in permanent plots suggest that only the individuals that recruited on the red alga, G. furcellatus, had a high probability of survival. The main agent of post-settlement mortality was the predatory whelk Nucella crassilabrum. Laboratory feeding trials show that the whelk prefers the small sizes of this mussel (1 to 3 cm in length) and above this size the mussel is largely free from whelk predation. Field observations confirm that mussel recruits remain attached to this alga for approximately a year and then they become fixed to the rocky substratum. A field experiment was done to test whether the alga did indeed provide a refuge from whelk predation. Survival of mussel recruits that had settled naturally on artificial collector was monitored. An artificial collector (Gymnogongrus imitation made with plastic nets) that was attached at only a single point to the substratum, restricted access of Nucella, and produced a correspondingly high level of survival among the mussel recruits. Alternately, an artificial collector fixed to the substratum at several point, allowed free access to Nucella and mussel survival was significantly lower. These result indicate that Gymnogongrus provides Choromytilus recruits with a short term refuge from predation. By restricting access of the whelk Nucella, Gymnogongrus allows Choromytilus recruits to reach a size at which Nucella is no longer a threat, ensuring the successful attachment of Choromytilus to the primary substratum. This algal refuge has important implications for the structure and dynamics of the Choromytilus rocky shore community.},

The popu-lation consisted primarily of urchins up to 40 mm in test diameter in a size distribution which changed from uni-modal to bimodal and back over the 2 yr study. Mortality was temporally variable and related to test diameter. Growth rates were somewhat lower than most previous reports for the species and suggested that most of the population was made up of 1 and 2 yr-old individuals. Diet consisted largely of geniculate coralline algae, with fleshy brown algae becoming important when available as drift. This study showed high densities of small urchins can exist in a California kelp forest inhabited by sea ot-ters, but regular recruitment may be necessary to main-tain such populations.},

A latitudinal gradient in ocean climate, particularly sea surface temperature (SST) and primary production, has been described along this coast. Here, we took advantage of this gradient in ocean climate to explore affinities in the biogenic landscape structure of subtidal shallow reefs (the abundance of habitat patches), as well as in the assemblage structure of macroalgae and associated fishes, between each of 3 regions: Viana do Castelo (41.5° N), Peniche (39.2° N) and Sines (37.8° N). Five reefs were sampled to determine the abundance of biogenic habitats and the assemblage structure of macroalgae and fishes in each region. The structure of the landscape, and of macroalgal and fish assemblages, differed between Viana do Castelo and Peniche and between Viana do Castelo and Sines, but not between Peniche and Sines. Viana do Castelo was the only region with conspicuous kelp forests, while Peniche and Sines were dominated by patches of foliose turf-forming and filamentous algae. Our study revealed an abrupt macroecological change from northern Portugal to central and southern Portugal, suggesting a possible biogeographical reconfiguration and recognition of a wider transitional area from the Atlantic into Mediterranean waters.},

The distribution of Heliocidaris erythrogramma coincides with the eastern Australia climate change hot spot, where disproportionate warming makes marine biota particularly vulnerable to climate change. In keeping with near-future climate change scenarios, we determined the interactive effects of warming and acidification on fertilization and development of this echinoid. Experimental treatments (20–26°C, pH 7.6–8.2) were tested in all combinations for the ‘business-as-usual' scenario, with 20°C/pH 8.2 being ambient. Percentage of fertilization was high ({\textgreater}89{\%}) across all treatments. There was no difference in percentage of normal development in any pH treatment. In elevated temperature conditions, +4°C reduced cleavage by 40 per cent and +6°C by a further 20 per cent. Normal gastrulation fell below 4 per cent at +6°C. At 26°C, development was impaired. As the first study of interactive effects of temperature and pH on sea urchin development, we confirm the thermotolerance and pH resilience of fertilization and embryogenesis within predicted climate change scenarios, with negative effects at upper limits of ocean warming. Our findings place single stressor studies in context and emphasize the need for experiments that address ocean warming and acidification concurrently. Although ocean acidification research has focused on impaired calcification, embryos may not reach the skeletogenic stage in a warm ocean.},

The effects of temperature on performance traits (i.e., growth and photosynthesis) and temperature tolerance ranges (i.e., survival) have been experimentally determined for a wide variety of seaweed species and explain large-scale biogeographic distribution patterns. In contrast, studies on temperature effects on cellular components (i.e., proteins and membranes) and environmentally induced changes in transcriptional processes still remain scarce. One major obstacle has been the lack of genomic information of seaweed species, which is now increasing. Furthermore, sophisticated ecological niche models have been applied in the recent years to predict geographical areas with suitable environmental conditions for marine seaweed species.},

however, have been made to quantify wrack's variability in
deposition, persistence, and utilization along beaches and the
rocky intertidal. Knowing the biomass deposited, persistence
(amount of time a piece of wrack is found in an area), and how
primary and secondary consumers respond to wrack allows for a
better understanding of how these three variables work together
to promote a food web and the ecological implications of the
presence/absence of wrack within an area. My work focused on
spatiotemporal variation in wrack deposition, persistence, and
utilization by kelp flies and bacteria in central California
from April 2013 to August 2014. Changes in wrack biomass
density, persistence on the shore, phlorotannin concentration,
bacterial density, and kelp fly density were measured along with
a suite of other factors including species composition,
condition (individual or fragmented), and burial. Over the study
period, a significant difference in biomass density was found
between substrates with higher amounts of wrack on the rocky
intertidal. In addition, persistence maps indicating hotspots of
prolonged wrack accumulation showed a significant increase in
kelp wrack at greater distances from the shoreline, such as the
berm on beaches and the high intertidal in the rocky intertidal,
although no difference between substrate was observed. In terms
of utilization, phlorotannin concentration did not appear to
affect bacterial abundance or fly density, which suggested that
the levels present in kelp wrack were not a strong deterrent for
bacteria and flies. A two-week experiment was also conducted,
which manipulated the weight of the giant kelp Macrocystis
pyrifera to determine its effect on the above-mentioned factors.
The rate of water loss and persistence was measured daily, while
utilization changes occurred on a slower scale and were measured
weekly. During this time, kelp fly density changed significantly
between substrate, while phlorotannins decreased significantly
over time. Again, there was no relationship between phlorotannin
concentration, bacterial abundance, or fly density, although
bacterial abundance and fly density increased when wrack was
rehydrated by high tides after initial desiccation. Quantifying
deposition, persistence, and utilization of kelp wrack is
important to establish baselines, make comparisons, and
understand the interactions taking place that can affect wrack's
ecological role as a subsidy.},

abstract = {In order to understand variability in recruitment to populations
of benthic and demersal marine species, it is critical to
distinguish between the contributions due to variations in larval
settlement versus those caused by post-settlement mortality. In
this study, fine-scale (1-2 days) temporal changes in recruit
abundance were followed through an entire settlement season in a
temperate demersal fish in order to determine 1) how dynamic the
process of recruitment is on a daily scale, 2) whether settlement
and post-settlement mortality are influenced by habitat structure
and conspecific density, and 3) how the relationship between
settlement and recruitment changes over time. ''Settlement'' is
considered to be the arrival of new individuals from the pelagic
habitat, and ''recruitment'' is defined as the number of
individuals surviving arbitrary periods of time after settlement.
Replicate standardized habitat units were placed in 2 spatial
configurations (clumped and randomly dispersed) and monitored
visually for cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) settlement and
recruitment every 1-2 days throughout the settlement season. The
process of recruitment in T. adspersus was highly variable at a
fine temporal scale. Changes in the numbers of recruits present
on habitat units were due to both settlement of new individuals
and mortality of animals previously recruited. The relative
importance of these two processes appeared to change from day to
day. The magnitude of the change in recruit number did not differ
between the clumped and random habitats. However, post-settlement
loss was significantly greater on randomly dispersed than clumped
habitats. During several sampling dates, the extent of the change
in recruit abundance was correlated with the density of resident
con-specifics; however, on other dates no such relationship
appeared to exist. Despite the presence of significant
relationships between the change in recruit number and density,
there was no evidence of either density-dependent mortality or
settlement. Initially, there was a strong relationship between
settlement and recruitment; however, this relationship weakened
over time. Within 2 months after the cessation of settlement,
post-settlement loss was greater than 99{\%}, and no correlation
remained between recruitment and the initial pattern of
settlement. The results of this study demonstrate that the
spatial arrangement of the habitat affects the rate and intensity
of post-settlement loss. Counter to much current thinking, this
study suggests that in order to understand the population ecology
of reef fishes, knowledge of what habitats new recruits use and
how mortality varies with structural aspects of the habitats is
essential.},

Here, I investigate the effect of a facilitator species on the abundance of macroalgae over a gradient of herbivory. Grazing by sea urchins can be intense on temperate reefs along the California coast, with benthic macroalgae growing exclusively in physical refuges and interspersed within colonies of the strawberry anemone, Corynactis californica. Field experiments indicated that the net effect of C. californica on turf algae was strongly nonlinear over a gradient in density of sea urchins. At low intensities of urchin grazing, the anemone and macroalgae competed for space, with algae capable of overgrowing C. californica. At intermediate grazing intensities, C. californica provided a refuge for turf algae but not for juvenile kelp. Neither turf algae nor kelp benefited from the presence of C. californica at the highest levels of grazing intensity, as sea urchins consumed nearly all macroalgae. The hump-shaped effect observed for C. californica contrasts with the prevailing view in ecological theory that positive interactions are more common in harsh environmental conditions. The results reported here qualify this view and underscore the need to evaluate positive interactions over a range of abiotic stress and consumer pressure.},

abstract = {An important aspect of particle trajectory modeling in the ocean is the assessment of the uncertainty in the final particle position. Monte Carlo particle trajectory simulations using surface currents derived from standard-range and long-range CODAR HF radar systems were performed using random-walk and random-flight models of the unresolved velocities. Velocity statistics for these models were derived from the covariance functions of differences between CODAR and drifter estimates of surface currents. Comparison of predicted trajectories and drifter tracks demonstrate that these predictions are superior to assuming the drifters stay at their initial position. Vertical shear between the effective depth of long-range CODAR measurements (∼2.4 m) and that of drifters (0.65 m) causes the drifters to move more rapidly downwind than predicted. This bias is absent when standard-range CODAR currents (effective depth ∼0.5 m) are used, implying that drifter leeway is not the cause of the bias. Particle trajectories were computed using CODAR data and the random-flight model for 24-hour intervals using a Monte Carlo approach to determine the 95{\%} confidence interval of position predictions. Between 80{\%} and 90{\%} of real drifters were located within the predicted confidence interval, in reasonable agreement with the expected 95{\%} success rate. In contrast, predictions using the random-walk approach proved inconsistent with observations unless the diffusion coefficient was increased to approximately the random-flight value. The consistency of the random-flight uncertainty estimates and drifter data supports the use of our methodology for estimating model parameters from drifter-CODAR velocity differences.},

abstract = {As global warming continues over the coming century, marine
organisms will experience a warmer, more acidic ocean. Although
these stressors may behave antagonistically or synergistically
and will impact organisms both directly (i.e., physiologically)
and indirectly (i.e., through altered species interactions), few
studies have examined the complexities of these effects in
combination. To address these uncertainties, we examined the
independent and combined effects of el- evated temperature and
pCO2 on the physiology of the adult sporophyte stage of giant
kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the grazing of the purple sea
urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. While elevating pCO2 alone
had no effect on M. pyrifera growth or photosynthetic carbon
uptake, elevating temperature alone resulted in a significant
reduction in both. How- ever, when M. pyrifera was grown under
elevated temperature and pCO2 together, growth and photosynthetic
carbon up- take significantly increased relative to ambient
conditions, suggesting an interaction of these factors on
photosynthetic physiology. S. purpuratus held under future
conditions generally exhibited reduced growth, and smaller gonads
than urchins held under present-day conditions. However, urchins
fed kelp grown under future conditions showed higher growth
rates, partially ameliorating this effect. Feeding rates were
variable over the course of the experiment, with only the first
feeding rate experiment showing significantly lower rates for
urchins held under future conditions. Together, these data
suggest that M. pyrifera may benefit physiologically from a
warmer, more acidic (i.e., higher pCO2 ) ocean while S.
purpuratus will likely be impacted negatively. Given that
kelp-urchin interactions can be important to kelp forest struc-
ture, changes to either of these populations may have serious

abstract = {With knowledge of typical hydrodynamic behavior of waste plastic material, models predicting the dispersal of benthic plastics from land sources within the ocean are possible. Here we investigated the hydrodynamic behavior (density, settling velocity and resuspension characteristics) of non-buoyant preproduction plastic pellets in the laboratory. From these results we used the MOHID modelling system to predict what would be the likely transport and deposition pathways of such material in the Nazar{\'{e}} Canyon (Portugal) during the spring/summer months of 2009 and the autumn/winter months of 2011. Model outputs indicated that non-buoyant plastic pellets would likely be transported up and down canyon as a function of tidal forces, with only a minor net down canyon movement resulting from tidal action. The model indicated that transport down canyon was likely greater during the autumn/winter, primarily as a result of occasional mass transport events related to storm activity and internal wave action. Transport rates within the canyon were not predicted to be regular throughout the canyon system, with stretches of the upper canyon acting more as locations of pellet deposition than conduits of pellet transport. Topography and the depths of internal wave action are hypothesized to contribute to this lack of homogeneity in predicted transport.},

abstract = {Many fish species are cryptic by nature or show a negative response to divers. This may make traditional censusing techniques difficult to perform and the results obtained using these methods may be inaccurate. This problem will be exacerbated in complex habitats, such as those found on coral reefs, because the cryptic species present will be even more difficult to locate and identify. Predation studies on coral reefs have been especially hampered by this problem because many predatory species are cryptic and so it has been difficult to obtain reliable abundance estimates. This study tested a visual census technique that used bait to bring cryptic predatory fish into view. Results from this census were then compared to those from a traditional survey using belt transects, and to a patch reef tagging study where all individuals of 3 key species were located. The baited technique produced significantly higher density estimates for 3 of the 4 most abundant cryptic species. The patch reef experiment demonstrated that the baited technique accounted for 85 to 96 {\%} of fish present. Censuses without bait observed only 40 to 61 {\%} of fish present. For mobile species, on the other hand, the baited census appeared to overestimate abundance, due to movement of fish into the census area. We therefore recommend combining baited censuses of sedentary cryptic species with traditional censuses of mobile species to gain an accurate picture of piscivorous reef fish communities. Using this approach at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef, the proportion of cryptic piscivores in the community was found to be almost double that which would have otherwise been observed. We also found considerable spatial variation in the abundance and distribution of piscivorous fish. These patterns would have been quite different had the survey been based on belt transects alone. Previous studies using belt transects may therefore have underestimated the importance of cryptic piscivorous species in communities of coral reef fish.},

abstract = {Abstract The coast along the temperate South East Pacific (SEP)
presents a simple linear topography with a north-south
orientation spanning more than 4600 km. However, environmental
heterogeneity associated with two major biogeographic boundaries
has been described along the SEP (30–33°S and 42°S). Recent
phylo- geographic studies of seaweeds revealed the existence of
different cryptic species along the SEP coast and that most of
the genetic breaks between them are broadly congruent with the
biogeographic boundaries. These phylogeographic patterns
characterized by genetic discontinuities could be attributed to
historical vicariance or to budding speciation. For SEP seaweeds,
two major phylogeographic patterns are observed. Endemic species
living north of 42°S show complex haplotype net- works and an
almost complete genetic isolation between populations located
only a few kilometres from each other. This extreme genetic
patchiness has been related to the combined effects of limited
dispersal, reduced population size and high popu- lation turnover
of these intertidal seaweeds due to stochastic effects of
climatic and tectonic catastrophes. On the other hand, species
with a range distribution limited to the south of 42°S and
inhabiting the area highly affected by the coastal ice cap during
the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), show typical signatures of
post-glacial demographic expansion. Finally, molecular studies
reveal that several species are recent immigrants from New
Zealand, demonstrating the importance of oceanic dispersal in
shaping the diversity of the SEP.},

of the kelp Ecklonia maxima, on various substrata, at depths of
2.5 to 5.0 m, was studied at 8 sites on the southwest coast of
South Africa. The most common substratum available was rock (bare
or covered with encrusting coralline algae), followed by kelp
holdfasts, and the ascidian Pyura stolonifera at some sites. A
disproportionately high ratio (relative to the available
substrata) of young sporophytes grew on the holdfasts of mature
kelps at most sites, but particularly where high densities of
benthic invertebrate grazers were present (mainly the urchin
Parechinus angulosus, also abalone Haliotis midae, limpets
Patella spp, and gastropods Turbo spp, and Oxystele spp.).
Jacobs' index of electivity was used an indicator of 'preference
for' (interpreted as indicating survival on) the substratum type.
This showed a statistically significant 'negative selection' of
rock as a substratum at sites where grazers were numerous. The
ratios of young sporophytes on holdfasts/young sporophytes on
rock were directly proportional to grazer densities when sites
were compared (r = -0.90, p = 0.002); supporting the hypothesis
that mature holdfasts are an important refuge for recruitment of
E. maxima sporophytes. There was an inverse relationship between
percentage cover of understorey algae and grazer densities (r =
0.92, p = 0.001). In general, sites east of Cape Point (west
coast/south coast transition zone) have far more grazers and
reduced understorey algal biomasses compared to west coast sites.
There thus appear to be fundamental differences in some of the
major ecological processes in kelp beds in these 2 areas, with
important implications for commercial kelp harvesting.},

abstract = {The relationship between hydrodynamic energy and biological
processes is examined for a kelp-dominated marine community,in
the San Juan Archipelago. Populations of a common and widely
distributed kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, were established and
rates and causes of mortality followed at 7 sites differing
greatly in tidally, driven current velocities and wave exposure
(measured by permanently deployed instrument packages). Mortality
of N luetkeana was not related to storm energy, but exhibited a
significant non-linear relationship with tidal current energy
such that mortality rates were highest at sites exhibiting
protracted periods of calm punctuated by episodes of strong
currents. The role of mesograzers (primarily the gastropod Lacuna
vincta) on survivorship in these kelp populations was evaluated
in the field and in laboratory flume experiments. The
relationship between grazer damage and stipe breaking force was
investigated by measuring the tensile forces required to break
experimentally damaged stipes. Although undamaged stipes can
easily withstand the tensile forces imposed by even the strongest
current and wave exposures, a very small amount of damage will
have highly significant negative effects on breaking strength.
While apparently responsible for a significant portion of N.
luetkeana mortality in low and variable energy environments, L.
vincta is unable to persist on kelp stipes in high-energy
environments and its role there is trivial, The relationship
between L. vincta grazing and hydrodynamic energy is however
nonlinear, because water movement has opposite effects on grazer
foraging behavior and the drag forces imposed on kelps, and this
results in a complex relationship between hydrodynamic energy and
kelp survival. We suggest a conceptual model for relating kelp
survival to grazing intensity in hydro-dynamically variable
environments. The model leads to the prediction, exhibited in our
field results, that the probability of plant mortality may be
maximized in regions of intermediate flow energy.},

In northern Chile, between 18 degrees-42 degrees S, the Cordillera de la Costa runs close to the coast generating extremely exposed habitats. In this zone two species of Lessonia are dominant in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Here, the sea urchin Tetrapygus niger is the most abundant grazer producing extensive intertidal and subtidal barren grounds. South of 42 degrees S to Cape Horn, Macrocystis pyrifera forms the most conspicuous kelp association in a fjord zone, where hundreds of islands produce protected habitats. Four species of sea urchins and the gastropod Tegula atra graze on M. pyrifera. However, their effects are spatially and temporary restricted. The foraging behavior of the principal herbivore, the sea urchin Loxechinus albus, is influenced by the degree of wave action, restricting its effect to exposed areas, In very protected areas Tegula atra affects the population dynamics of M. pyrifera.},

abstract = {Macroalgae are a diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic lower organisms and offer indispensable ecosystem services towards sustainable productivity of rocky coastal areas. The earlier studies have mainly focused on elucidation of the roles of the epiphytic bacterial communities in the ecophysiology of the host macroalga. However, mutualistic interactions have become topic of current interest. It is evident from recent studies that a fraction of epiphytic bacterial communities can be categorized as “core microbial species”, suggesting an obligate association. Epiphytic bacterial communities have also been reported to protect macroalgal surfaces from biofouling microorganisms through production of biologically active metabolites. Because of their intrinsic roles in the host life cycle, the host in turn may provide necessary organic nutrients in order to woo pelagic microbial communities to settle on the host surfaces. However, the precise composition of microbiomes and their functional partnership with hosts are hardly understood. In contrast, the microbial studies associated with human skin and gut and plants have significantly advanced our knowledge on microbiome and their functional interactions with the host. This has led to manipulation of the microbial flora of the human gut and of agricultural plants for improving health and performance. Therefore, it is highly imperative to investigate the functional microbiome that is closely involved in the life cycles of the host macroalgae using high-throughput techniques (metagenomics and metatranscriptomics). The findings from such investigations would help in promoting health and productivity in macroalgal species through regulation of functionally active microbiome.},

Movements of A. vulgaris were more directed towards the prey under back-and-forth water movement than under still conditions. The presence of kelp blades without waves also reduced the movement of sea stars towards prey as the sea stars largely stayed in the portion of the tank without kelp. Sea stars only became detached in treatments with waves, and a greater proportion detached when both waves and kelp were present. The success rate of sea stars in capturing mussels was null in the treatment with both waves and kelp. These observations support the hypothesis that the kelp canopy in shallow water, and movement of the kelp blades by waves, provide mussels with a spatial refuge from sea star predation.

abstract = {This final report is the result of research during the five and
one-half year period from September 1948 to March 1954.
Throughout the investigation the apparent decline of sport fish
was causing sport fishermen great concern. Among other factors,
kelp harvesting was blamed for the poor catch of the sportsman.
More than a year after the beginning of this investigation, the
Kelco Company approached the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
of the University of California, with the request that the
problems of kelp cutting in relation to the fish supply be
attacked by the University under a fellowship grant, by
unprejudiced research. The Company wanted to determine whether
the kelp operations were adversely affect­ing fishing, and if so,
how harvesting methods might be altered to prevent this. The
first phase of the program was concerned with observation and
identification. Thousands of hours were spent above and below the
surface observing the organisms in their own environment.
Extensive use was made of scuba diving equipment for
observations, collection, and placing of equipment. Underwater
photography was developed to a point where many observations
could be recorded. The second phase of the program was to
appraise the effects of kelp harvesting on fish life. Because of
the lack of pertinent published data on the ecology of the
inshore waters, it was necessary to investigate not only the beds
of the main commercial kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), but also many
other regions, in order to obtain comparative data. Such areas
included bays, rocky areas below the levels where kelp grows,
rocky areas with no kelp, the surf zones, sandy areas, and
regions outside the West Coast range of Macrocystis. Kelp beds
were studied as far north as Monterey and as far south as the San
Benito Islands, Baja California. Diving observations in the kelp
were made at Monterey, Morro Bay, Goleta, Santa Barbara, Point
Dume, Palos Verdes, Newport, Laguna, Dana Point, San Clemente,
Del Mar, Solana Beach, La Jolla, Point Loma, Ensenada, Punta San
Carlos, Punta Blanca, Punta Santa Rosalia, and numerous other
points along the mainland; also at San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa
Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Catalina, Coronado, San Martin, and San
Benito Islands. Intensive studies of the problem were carried out
in Orange and San Diego Counties, with special concentra­tion on
the nearby La Jolla kelp beds. One portion of the La Jolla kelp
beds was left uncut as a control. Little difference has been
noted in the fish life within the bed as contrasted with
harvested beds. The kelp itself became more sparse, probably
because of reduced light penetration through the heavy canopy
that developed tem­porarily. In the 1952-53 winter season much of
the kelp was de­stroyed by storms. These studies yielded a vast
amount of information bearing not only on the kelp problem but
also on the life ways of the fishes. As a result of these long
and thorough studies, it is concluded that kelp harvesting, as
cutrrently practiced, has no seriously detrimental effects on
fishing. The various claims as to the ways in which kelp
harvesting was supposed to destroy fish life and to decrease the
fish catch were completely investi­gated and found to be in
error. Spawning and nursery grounds of fish are not being
destroyed. Sufficient cover and food are always available during
and after harvesting. The kelp beds are not destroyed by
harvesting methods. Harvesters do not frighten sportfish from an
area. For several decades California has experienced a tremendous
increase in population. Cities have grown where deserts and
foothills were the homes of deer, rabbits, ground squirrels,
ground owls, doves,and quail. In most places these animals have
largely disappeared, and with them the intertidal mollusks —
Pismo clams, butter clams, abalone, and many other species. The
shore fishes such as corbina and spotfin croaker are less common
in the individual fisherman's catch. Over kelp beds where a man
might have fished alone a decade or two ago, we may see 50 sport
boats with a total of 1000 anglers. Thus, even though the annual
catch may be the same as or higher than 10 or 20 years ago, the
catch per fisherman is much lower. The kelp industries have
arisen indirectly from our social-economic needs for new raw
materials to fill new markets. They have become established in
our economy and are essential for the production of certain new
products. As is typical of modern, young industries, they have
conducted research to determine the maximum sustained yield. The
industry naturally has no desire to destroy kelp. The
sportfishing industry is large and provides recreation, necessary
for our nation's health, to thousands of persons. With the
addition of thou­sands of newcomers to sportfishing and the
reduction of catch per unit of effort, it is not difficult to
understand the fishermen's concern over factors supposedly
destroying their sport. It is necessary, however, to determine
the real reason for the apparent decline of fish before any
constructive action can be taken. It may be a problem of
overfishing or of natural population fluctuations, but the blame
cannot be laid to the kelp harvesting.},

nutrients required for photosynthesis. The interaction of algal
blades with flow often involves dynamic reorientations of the
blade surface (pitching and flapping) that may in turn affect
nutrient flux. As a first step toward understanding the
consequences of blade motion, we explore the effect of
oscillatory pitching on the flux to a flat plate and to two
morphologies of the kelp Eisenia arborea. In slow flow
(equivalent to a water velocity of 2.7 cm s(-1)), pitching
increases the time-averaged flux to both kelp morphologies, but
not to the plate. In fast flow (equivalent to 20 cm s(-1) in
water), pitching has negligible effect on flux regardless of
shape. For many aspects of flux, the flat plate is a reliable
model for the flow-protected algal blade, but predictions made
from the plate would substantially underestimate the flux to the
flow-exposed blade. These measurements highlight the complexities
of flow-related nutrient transport and the need to understand
better the dynamic interactions among nutrient flux, blade
motion, blade morphology, and water flow.},

Consequently, kelp are well represented in the literature,

phylogeny of the ``derived'' kelp families (viz., Agaraceae,
Alariaceae, Laminariaceae, and Lessoniaceae). The formerly

expanded Arthrothamnaceae including Arthrothamnus, Cymathaere,
Ecklonia, Macrocystis, Nereocystis, Pelagophycus, Postelsia,
Pseudolessonia, Saccharina, and Streptophyllopsis, which rendered
both the Laminariaceae and Lessoniaceae monogeneric. A published
eight-gene alignment, the most marker-rich prior to this study,
was expanded and analyzed to facilitate inclusion of Aureophycus.
Although the topology was unchanged at the family level between
the transcriptome data set relative to eight-gene analyses, the
superior resolving power of the former was clearly established.},

abstract = {In marine environments, many species have apparently colonized
high latitude regions fol- lowing the last glacial maximum (LGM)
yet lack a life-history stage, such as a free-living larva, that
is clearly capable of long-distance dispersal. Two hypotheses can
explain the modern high latitude distributions of these marine
taxa: (1) survival in northern refugia during the LGM or (2)
rapid post-glacial dispersal by nonlarval stages. To distinguish
these two scenarios, I characterized the genetic structure of two
closely related northeastern Pacific gastropods that lack
planktonic larvae but which have distributions extending more
than 1000 km north of the southern limit of glaciers at the LGM.
Despite having identical larval dispersal potential, these
closely related species exhibit fundamentally different pat-
terns of genetic structure. In Nucella ostrina , haplotype
diversity among northern popu- lations (British Columbia and
Alaska) is low, no pattern of isolation by distance exists and a
coalescent-based model of population growth indicates that during
the LGM population size was reduced to less than 35{\%} of its
current size. In the congeneric and often sympatric N. lamellosa
, northern populations harbour a diversity of ancient private
haplotypes, sig- nificant evidence of isolation by distance
exists and regional subdivision was found between northern
(Alaska) and southern (southern British Columbia, Washington and
Oregon) popu- lations. Estimates of coalescent parameters
indicate only a modest reduction in population size during the
LGM and that northern and southern populations of N. lamellosa
split ∼ 50 Kyr before the LGM. The patterns are consistent with
the hypothesis that N. ostrina recently reinvaded the
northeastern Pacific but N. lamellosa survived the LGM in a
north- ern refuge. A comparison of similar studies in this region
indicates that depleted levels of genetic variation at high
latitudes — evidence suggestive of recent colonization from a
southern refuge — is more common among intertidal species that
live relatively high on the shore, where exposure times to cold
stress in air are longer than for species living lower on the
shore. These data suggest that for some faunas, ecological
differences between taxa may be more important than larval
dispersal potential in determining species' long-term
biogeographical responses to climate change.},

We propose a new, expanded classification of morphological functional groups based on thallus structure, growth form, branching pattern, and taxonomic affinities. This approach was tested on subtidal macroalgal assemblages of the western Mediterranean. We examined the differences in composition of assemblages subjected to different types of stressors using species, traditional morphological groups, and new morphological groups. Results showed that the new morphological groups allowed to detect patterns highlighted through species analyses generally better than the use of traditional morpho-functional groups. The new morphological groups may represent a valid tool in monitoring programs and environmental impact assessments, where it is important to detect early stages of environmental changes using methods that allow to examine a large number of samples in a limited time.},

abstract = {Abstract Climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation play an important role in controlling local and regional scale differences in population dynamics and species distributions, and large-scale climatic events such as El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) have been shown to affect population dynamics of key species in many ecosystems, particularly in kelp forests. Few studies have been able to evaluate the consequences of climate variables on the structure and dynamics of biological communities, in large part because the lack of data at appropriate spatial and temporal scales has made it difficult to adequately address local-scale responses of species and communities to such events over relevant time scales. Here, we combined an unprecedented dataset of kelp forest species' abundances from the Channel Islands, California with data for several local, regional, and global scale climatic variables to evaluate the temporal and spatial scale at which one can detect community-wide effects of climate variables, in particular ENSO events. We found large and significant local-scale differences in community structure, but these differences were not related to differences in climatic variables. Moreover, giant kelp abundance, which has been shown to be highly sensitive to water temperature and storm disturbance, was a poor predictor of community differences, and all communities tended to decline in abundance over the 20-year sampling period, suggesting a press perturbation to the system such as PDO cycles or sustained fishing pressure. Although ENSO events can have dramatic impacts on the abundance and distribution of giant kelp itself across the range of the species, such events appear to have little effect on local-scale kelp forest community structure or dynamics.},

Natural fluctuations in ambient environmental conditions influence the intrinsic characteristics of gametes, which define their ability to tolerate varied conditions. The aim of this work was to document seasonal patterns in reproduction and gametophyte growth and survival of Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh in south-western Australia. These results were related to patterns in local environmental conditions in an attempt to ascertain which factors explain variation throughout the season. E. radiata was fertile (produced zoospores) for three and a half months over summer and autumn. Every two weeks during this time, gametophytes were grown in a range of temperatures (16–22uC) in the laboratory. Zoospore densities were highly variable among sample periods; however, zoospores released early in the season produced gametophytes which had greater rates of growth and survival, and these rates declined towards the end of the reproductive season. Growth rates of gametophytes were positively related to day length, with the fastest growing recruits released when the days were longest. Gametophytes consistently survived best in the lowest temperature (16uC), yet exhibited optimum growth in higher culture temperatures (20–22uC). These results suggest that E. radiata releases gametes when conditions are favourable for growth, and E. radiata gametophytes are tolerant of the range of temperatures observed at this location. E. radiata releases the healthiest gametophytes when day length and temperature conditions are optimal for better germination, growth, and sporophyte production, perhaps as a mechanism to help compete against other species for space and other resources.

abstract = {Abstract Empirical orthogonal functions (E0Fs) and composite
analyses are used to investigate the development of sea surface
temperature (SST) anomaly patterns over the tropical Atlantic.
The evolution of large-scale rainfall anomaly patterns over the
equatorial Atlantic and South America are also investigated. The
EOF analyses revealed that a pattern of anomalous SST and wind
stress asymmetric relative to the equator is the dominant mode
of interannual and longer variability over the tropical
Atlantic. The most important findings of this study are as
follows. Atmospheric circulation anomalies precede the
development of basinwide anomalous SST patterns over the
tropical Atlantic. Anomalous SST originate off the African coast
simultaneously with atmospheric circulation anomalies and expand
westward afterward. The time lag between wind stress relaxation
(strengthening) and maximum SST warming (cooling) is about two
months. Anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns over northern
tropical Atlantic are phase locked to the seasonal cycle.
Composite fields of SLP and wind stress over northern tropical
Atlantic can be distinguished from random only within a few
months preceding the March?May (MAM) season. Observational
evidence is presented to show that the El Ni{\~{n}}o?Southern
Oscillation phenomenon in the Pacific influences atmospheric
circulation and SST anomalies over northern tropical Atlantic
through atmospheric teleconnection patterns into higher
latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The well-known droughts
over northeastern Brazil (Nordeste) are a local manifestation of
a much larger-scale rainfall anomaly pattern encompassing the
whole equatorial Atlantic and Amazon region. Negative rainfall
anomalies to the south of the equator during MAM, which is the
rainy season for the Nordeste region, are related to an early
withdrawal of the intertropical convergence zone toward the warm
SST anomalies over the northern tropical Atlantic. Also, it is
shown that precipitation anomalies over southern and northern
parts of the Nordeste are out of phase: drought years over the
northern Nordeste are commonly preceded by wetter years over the
southern Nordeste, and vice versa.},

common: up to 85{\%} of holdfasts on a beach may contain up to
116g CaCO3 each. Sand and carbonate trapped in haptera, along
with encrusting carbonate-producing organisms, have a mass of up
to tens of grammes. While most dislodged macroalgae land close
to where they came from, others may be stranded many thousands
of km from their place of origin. Sediment deposited by
macroalgal transport depends largely on the characteristics of
local source rocks. While hard rocks may only provide a few
gm−2y−1, highly fractured basalt has been shown to provide up to
78gm−2y−1. Rock transport by macroalgae is less than carbonate
flux, which may reach over 8000gm−2y−1. Based on the projected
abundance of macroalgal rafts, some 350tonnes of sediment (both
carbonate and clastic) may be afloat in the Southern Ocean at
any one time. Macroalgal transport may explain the presence of
exotic rocks and shells found far from their source environment.
While cold-climate rafting of sediment is dominated by glacial
processes, in warm periods rafting may be limited to biological
transport. Overall the transport of rock and carbonate by
macroalgae has the potential in some environments of being a
significant source of sediment.},

We describe growing evidence that organisms have significant nontrophic impacts on ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity, and outline established means of identifying key species involved in niche construction.

fisheries, a fact which contributes to their disproportionately
high economic value. They are, however, also among the most
extensively modified and threatened of aquatic environments.
Almost all have been strongly affected by human beings, and
fisheries are an integral part of human activities on the coast.
We have taken a global perspective in synthesizing the effects of
fishing on estuaries and coastal waters. Rather than attempt to
cover all regions of the world in detail, we review eight
process-orientated categories affected by fishing, with case
studies for each of them: target organisms, non-target organisms,
nursery functions, trophic effects, habitat change, reduced water
quality, human environment, and potential for local extinctions.
Fishing in the estuarine and near-shore environment has clear
impacts on the structure and functioning of these ecosystems,
although other, non-fishing issues also effect these ecosystems.
This creates multiple interactions and reinforces the need for an
integrated approach to coastal zone management. Nonetheless, some
form of fish-based action plan could be created, especially
within estuaries, which would provide management objectives for a
particular system.},

abstract = {South of Africa, the Agulhas Current retroflects and a portion
of its waters flows into the South Atlantic Ocean1, typically in
the form of Agulhas rings2. This flux of warm and salty water
from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean (the Agulhas leakage) is
now recognized as a key element in global climate3. An Agulhas
leakage shutdown has been associated with extreme glacial
periods4, whereas a vigorous increase has preceded shifts
towards interglacials5. In the absence of a coherent observing
system, studies of the Agulhas have relied heavily on ocean
models, which have revealed a possible recent increase in
Agulhas leakage6,7,8. However, owing to the high levels of
oceanic turbulence, model solutions of the region are highly
sensitive to their numerical choices9,10, stressing the need for
observations to confirm these important model results. Here,
using satellite altimetry observations from 1993 to 2009, we
show that the mesoscale variability of the Agulhas system, in
particular in the Mozambique Channel and south of Madagascar,
has intensified. This seems to result from an increased South
Equatorial Current driven by enhanced trade winds over the
tropical Indian Ocean. Overall, the intensified mesoscale
variability of the Agulhas system is reflected in accelerated
eddy propagation, in its source regions as well as the
retroflection from which eddies propagate into the South
Atlantic Ocean. This suggests that the Agulhas leakage may have
increased from 1993 to 2009, confirming previous modelling
studies that have further implied an increased Agulhas leakage
may compensate a deceleration of meridional overturning
circulation associated with a freshening of the North Atlantic

abstract = {The effects of grazers (mostly gastropods), height on the shore, wave-exposure, season of the year and the presence of shallow rock-pools on the abundance of intertidal macroalgae were examined on shores at Cape Banks (Botany Bay). At the beginning of each of the four seasons, experimental plots with and without grazers were cleared at four heights on three shores, of increasing exposure to waves, The colonization and growth of algae in these plots were monitored (by measurement of per cent cover and dry wt) for approximately the next 3 months in each season. In grazed plots, foliose algae only grew at the lowest levels on the shores. They were more abundant where wave-action was greater, and during the cooler periods of the year, when growth of the plants was enhanced. Higher on the shore, there was a positive correlation between algal cover in grazed plots and the amount of rainfall during the previous 10 days. In all seasons, there was much greater colonization of foliose algae where grazers were excluded. There was greater algal growth at lower levels on the shore, and where wave-action was stronger. Less algae grew in sheltered areas during warmer times of the year. The major seasonal difference found was the more rapid growth and occupancy of the rock by algae during the cooler seasons of the year. Experimental rock-pools were colonized more rapidly at lower levels on the shore, and during the winter. There was no difference between pools and control (non-pool) areas during winter. During summer, however, there was a greater per cent cover and biomass of algae in pools from which grazers had been excluded than in similar control areas. The results can be interpreted as being due to the greater survival and more rapid growth of algae under conditions of increased moisture, decreased emersion and decreased temperatures and light regimes during low tide (i.e. when physical stresses were reduced). These physical factors were, however, less important to the distribution of the algae than were the effects of grazers. Although few algae were present in any experimental plot, the number of species of algae per plot was considerably reduced in grazed areas. The results confirm that the patterns of vertical distribution and abundance of algae on rock-platforms in New South Wales are primarily the result of the activities of grazers. All algae in the present study were capable of living higher on the shore than they were normally found. Much of the variation along a gradient of wave-exposure, from season to season, and small-scale variation from place to place at any time can be explained by the complex interactions between the activities of grazers, and the effects of variations in the physical environment that influence the recruitment, survival and growth of the algae. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

influence the outcome of chemically mediated seaweed-herbivore
interactions. The unpalatable brown seaweed Dictyota ciliolata
produces the diterpenoid secondary metabolites pachydictyol A,
dictyol B acetate, and dictyodial. At natural concentrations,
pachydictyol A deterred the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata but
did not inhibit feeding by the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides or the
amphipod Ampithoe longimana until concentrations were 2.5-5
times natural levels. Dictyol B acetate deterred the urchin,
amphipod, and pinfish at, or far below, natural concentrations.
Dictyodial was too unstable to assay directly, but indirect
experiments suggested that natural concentrations deterred the
urchin, but not the pinfish or amphipod. Mild desiccation of D.
ciliolata reduced concentrations of the different secondary
metabolites by 7-38{\%} and plants became 2.6-3.4 times more
susceptible to urchin and amphipod grazing. The combined
concentrations of pachydictyol A and dictyol B acetate found in
undesiccated Dictyota ciliolata deterred feeding by urchins, but
this deterrent effect was lost at concentrations found in the
desiccated plants. Desiccated and undesiccated plants did not
differ in nutritive value (as measured by protein and total N
content) or toughness. Thus, desiccated plants became more
palatable because chemical defenses were lost, not because
nutritive value was increased. The stress of near-surface
ultraviolet radiation also caused significant physiological
changes in Dictyota ciliolata. UV-exposed blades bleached,
senesced, and grew 84{\%} less than blades protected from UV
radiation. Tissue loss and minimal growth of UV-stressed plants
constrained our sample sizes, but the limited assays that could
be run suggested that UV stress may lower chemical defenses and
increase plant susceptibility to herbivores. Because many
previous investigations of herbivore feeding patterns used
animals that had been starved for days before an assay, we
tested the effects of this commonly used procedure on feeding
discrimination. Recently fed urchins always avoided food
containing natural concentrations of pachydictyol A during
separate feeding trials performed on each of four consecutive
days. In contrast, urchins deprived of food for 3 d before this
assay did not avoid the treated food on days 1 and 2 of feeding
trials, but did avoid it on days 3 and 4 after their hunger was
reduced by feeding during days 1 and 2. If we had used only
starved urchins (a common procedure in previous investigations),
we could have concluded, with apparent justification, that
urchins were unaffected by pachydictyol A (if the assays were
run for only 1-2 d) or that they needed 2 d of exposure to the
compound in order to learn to avoid it. Both of these
conclusions would have been incorrect.]},

Attachment strength increased with shell area, and was influenced by the location of the mussel within the aggregation, and by the exposure of the habitat. M. caljfornianus had a stronger attachment than M. edulis. In both species, significantly greater force was required to dislodge mussels at the edge of the mussel bed than at the center. The mean attachment strength of M. edulis was 15 times greater in exposed habitats than in protected habitats. In the lab and field, mussels overgrown by kelp encountered flow-induced forces that were 2 to 6 times greater than flow forces on the mussels alone. Flow-induced forces ranged from 0.12 to 1.08 Newtons, and increased with velocity from 12 to 62 cm S-'. There was no significant relation between surface area of attached kelp and drag. Flow force data and surveys of dislodged mussels at an exposed beach indicate that epizoans increase the risk of mussel dislodgement, which has {\~{}}mportant implications for intertidal mussel beds impacted by disturbance events.},

abstract = {Abstract? The ecology of Australia's most extensive
canopy-forming alga, Ecklonia radiata, is often studied with
little regard as to whether it occurs in monospecific stands or
as part of a mixed assemblage of canopy-forming algae. We tested
the hypothesis that E. radiata does not primarily occur as
monospecific stands, rather it occurs more often in stands of
mixed algae. At a 1-m2 scale we recognized three main
configurations within forests of algae (hereafter called
stands): E. radiata that occurs as (i) monospecific stands; (ii)
clumps (four or more individuals together) surrounded by species
of Fucales; or (iii) individual plants (or clusters of fewer
than three plants) interspersed among species of Fucales. All
three types of stand occurred in similar proportions (percentage
cover) across two regions of Australia's southern coastline
(Western and South Australia). We also tested the hypothesis
that these three types of stands (identified at 1 m2) contain
different assemblages of invertebrates associated with the
holdfast of E. radiata. Assemblages of invertebrates varied
between monospecific and interspersed stands, but not between
monospecific and clumped stands. These results suggest that
variation in the configuration of subtidal algae (stands
measured at a 1-m2 scale) has the potential to influence the
composition and abundance of associated biota. We suggest that
although studies in stands of monospecific E. radiata may
provide useful information for the majority of forests
containing E. radiata (monospecific and clumped stands made up
65{\%} of forests sampled), caution must be used when
extrapolating to stands of mixed, interspersed algae ({\textgreater}31{\%} of
forests sampled).},

abstract = {Recent work on European (Swedish and English) populations of
Ascophyllum nodosum has detected inducible defenses in response
to snail grazing that include a decrease in algal palatability
and an increase in phlorotannin concentration, a class of
potential chemical defenses. However, tests of induced responses
in other A. nodosum populations are lacking and we thus have a
limited understanding of how widespread such responses are in
fucoid algae. We exposed a North American (Massachusetts) A.
nodosum population to Littorina obtusata, the same snail species
used in previous studies, and tested for the presence of
inducible responses during 2 experiments. In contrast to European
populations, the North American population of A. nodosum did not
develop any such responses. Exposure to either direct grazing or
just waterborne cues associated with grazing for 26 d failed to
suppress the palatability of artificial foods made from seaweed
tissues exposed to these treatments. In addition, exposure to
grazer cues did not increase seaweed phlorotannin levels compared
to controls. The lack of induced responses in the North American
population cannot be attributed to tissue type or potential
seasonal variation in inducibility because each of our 2
independent experiments tested for responses in 2 tissue types
(apical tips and basal shoots) in both the winter and spring.
Furthermore, consistent with European work, the North American
population lacked obvious grazing damage at the time of
collection, suggesting that the differences we observed were
unrelated to recent history with grazers. Thus, our work and that
of others indicates that A. nodosum displays considerable
inter-population variability in its response to a single
herbivore species.},

abstract = {It has often been observed that the abundance of sea urchins is lower inside kelp forests and along their nearshore edges than outside their offshore boundaries. We tested the hypothesis that this distributional pattern is a reflection of settlement patterns by monitoring settlement on artificial surfaces at 3 kelp forests near San Diego, California, USA. We estimated settlement at paired sites under the canopy and outside the offshore edge of the kelp forests and at paired sites located 20 m outside the canopy near the inshore and offshore boundaries of each kelp forest. There was no evidence of an effect of dense stands of giant kelp on the settlement of purple sea urchins. The results for red sea urchins were ambiguous; in 3 of 7 comparisons, average settlement was higher or observations of higher settlement were more frequent offshore from the kelp forest than elsewhere. Although this could result from different effects on the 2 species, we think it probably was due to accidents of sampling. We conclude that the distributional patterns of purple and red sea urchins relative to kelp forests are unlikely to reflect larval availability or settlement, but are more probably a function of post-settlement events, We qualify our conclusions because of the tremendous temporal variability in the physical and biological factors that can potentially affect the local distribution of sea urchin larvae. The 2 years of this study may be short relative to natural cycles.},

vulnerable to changes in quantity and quality of their water
supply, and it is expected that climate change will have a
pronounced effect on wetlands through alterations in hydrological
regimes with great global variability. Wetland habitat responses
to climate change and the implications for restoration will be
realized differently on a regional and mega-watershed level,

Floodplains, mangroves, seagrasses, saltmarshes, arctic wetlands,
peatlands, freshwater marshes and forests are very diverse
habitats, with different stressors and hence different management
and restoration techniques are needed. The Sundarban (Bangladesh

effects of climate change are evolving in different ways. Thus,
successful long term restoration and management of these systems

to climate and socio-economic changes, and these trends are
predicted to accelerate during the twenty-first century. To
understand these changing risks, and the resulting choices and
pathways to successful management and adaptation, broad-scale
integrated assessment is essential. Due to their complexity the
two risks of flooding and erosion are usually managed
independently, yet frequently they are interconnected by
longshore exchange of sediments and the resulting broad scale
morphological system behaviour. In order to generate new insights
into the effects of climate change and coastal management
practises on coastal erosion and flood risk, we present an
integrated assessment of 72 km of shoreline over the twenty-first
century on the East Anglian coast of England which is a site of
significant controversy about how to manage coastal flood and
erosion risks over the twenty-first century. A coupled system of
hydrodynamic, morphological, reliability and socio-economic
models has been developed for the analysis, implemented under
scenarios of coastal management, climate and socio-economic
change. The study is unique in coastal management terms because
of the large spatial scale and extended temporal scale over which
the analysis is quantified. This study for the first time
quantifies what has for some years been argued qualitatively: the
role of sediments released from cliff erosion in protecting
neighbouring low-lying land from flooding. The losses and
benefits are expressed using the common currency of economic
risk. The analysis demonstrates that over the twenty-first
century, flood risk in the study area is expected to be an order
of magnitude greater than erosion risk. Climate and
socio-economic change and coastal management policy have a
significant influence on flood risk. This study demonstrates that
the choices concerning coastal management are profound, and there
are clear tradeoffs between erosion and flood impacts.},

abstract = {The recruitment of algae is a critical process during algal colonization and invasions, including coral- to-algal phase shifts. Although algae are widely as- sumed to colonize and kill corals, there is very little known about the recruitment dynamics of coral reef algae. This study tested the ability of two dominant macroalgae (Fucales including Sargassum spp. and Lobophora variegata) to settle and grow on healthy coral tissue. The study also explored the effects of interactions with prior occupants, and of abiotic sub- strate properties (texture, and ceramic and carbonate material). The results indicate that healthy corals were able to prevent attachment or survival of recruits of these macroalgae. This is a significant point, since it suggests that the replacement of corals by algae may often require prior stress or death in the coral tissue. Pre-conditioning of plates at different sites had some effects, but these were relatively minor, whereas there was considerable variation within sites. Some of this variation appeared to be related to the amount of turf algae or crustose coralline algae on the plates. Recruitment was generally, but not always, higher on plates with rougher texture. Overall, this preliminary exploration indicates considerable potential for vari- ability in outcomes of algal colonization, with implica- tions for the dynamics of algal invasions. In particular, the results do not support suggestions that planktonic algal propagules can directly settle on and colonize healthy coral tissue.},

abstract = {Benthic marine organisms are characterized by a bipartite life history$\backslash$nin which populations of sedentary adults are connected by oceanic$\backslash$ntransport of planktonic propagules. In contrast with the terrestrial$\backslash$ncase, where 'long distance dispersal' (LDD) has traditionally been$\backslash$nviewed as a process involving rare events, this creates the possibility$\backslash$nfor large numbers of offspring to travel far relative to the spatial$\backslash$nscale of adult populations. As a result, the concept of LDD must$\backslash$nbe examined carefully when applied in a marine context. Any measure$\backslash$nof LDD requires reference to an explicit 'local' scale, often defined$\backslash$nin terms of adult population demography, habitat patchiness, or the$\backslash$naverage dispersal distance. Terms such as 'open' and 'closed' are$\backslash$nrelative, and should be used with caution, especially when compared$\backslash$nacross different taxa and systems. We use recently synthesized data$\backslash$non marine propagule dispersal potential and the spread of marine$\backslash$ninvasive species to draw inferences about average and maximum effective$\backslash$ndispersal distances for marine taxa. Foremost, our results indicate$\backslash$nthat dispersal occurs at a wide range of scales in marine communities.$\backslash$nThe nonrandom distribution of these scales among community members$\backslash$nhas implications for marine community dynamics, and for the implementation$\backslash$nof marine conservation efforts. Second, in agreement with theoretical$\backslash$nresults, our data illustrate that average and extreme dispersal scales$\backslash$ndo not necessarily covary. This further confounds simple classifications$\backslash$nof 'short' and 'long' dispersers, because different ecological processes$\backslash$n(e. g. range expansion vs. population replenishment) depend on different$\backslash$naspects of the dispersal pattern (e. g. extremes vs. average). Our$\backslash$nfindings argue for a more rigorous quantitative view of scale in$\backslash$nthe study of marine dispersal processes, where relative terms such$\backslash$nas 'short' and 'long', 'open' and 'closed', 'retained' and 'exported'$\backslash$nare defined only in conjunction with explicit definitions of the$\backslash$nscale and process of interest.

abstract = {All species have evolved in the presence of distur- bance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Conse- quently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturba- tions within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physi- cally based disturbance (for example, storm, volca- nic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dis- persal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that de- scribe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or ‘‘ecological surprises.'' In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state.We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthro- pogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century. Key},

abstract = {[ABSTRACT: Ecological effects caused by submerged aquatic
vegetation not only depend on the plants and their morphology
but also on the flow and transport patterns of dissolved and
suspended constituents near the canopy. Canopy height is a major
variable in any quantitative analysis of plant biomass and
constituent transport in its vicinity. Height of eelgrass
Zostera marina canopies changes due to bending of the blades
under varying current regimes. In this paper, I mathematically
modeled the coupling between eelgrass blade bending and water
flow. Based on the balance of forces of drag, lift, friction,
weight and buoyancy on a single blade, the model defined the
bending of blades (i.e. height of canopy) and the flow response
within and above the canopy. This coupling was tested using
laboratory data and indicated that the model performed
adequately. Both model results and laboratory data confirmed
that the bending of blades, and hence canopy height, was very
sensitive to current magnitude and directly influenced current
profile. Identifying canopy height is a major factor in defining
spatial distribution of grass biomass from optical or acoustic
remote sensing devices. The model has direct implications for
biological issues related to the plants themselves and to their
associated organisms, such as the vertical distribution of
photosynthesis within the canopy and the effect of current shear
on recruitment of organisms on the blades. It can also be used
to study how eelgrass canopies affect horizontal transport of
constituents, such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients and organic
carbon, and particulate material such as pollen, larvae,
plankton and detritus.]},

abstract = {Stereo Baited Remote Underwater Video systems (BRUVs) provide a quantitative sampling method for assessing mobile fauna in a range of habitat types and environments. This non-destructive and cost-effective technique is increasingly used for assessing estuarine, coastal and marine fauna. Although single camera systems have been used to assess the relative abundance (Nmax) of marine fish and invertebrates in low visibility North Atlantic near shore and coastal waters, stereo systems remain in their infancy within such environments and their use requires validation. Stereo systems that measure fish and invertebrate size enable size-frequency analysis of populations, providing critical information about life history and population status. We investigated the performance and efficacy of stereo BRUV systems within Welsh shallow coastal waters to test the effectiveness of this method. Data are presented on the capacity of the system to measure fish and invertebrate size under the constraints of low visibility ({\textless}2m). We also present data on the required duration of deployment required to effectively sample relative fish abundance and diversity. Our study recorded 19 species of mobile fauna with species-time accumulation curves providing evidence that a minimum deployment time of 1h is required to sample 66{\%} of the fish species, and 2h to sample 83{\%}. Results suggest that the efficiency of surveys for target species (e.g. gadoids) could be maximised by modifying the sampling duration between 1h and 2h. The study also demonstrates that measurements of fish and invertebrate length could be taken on 41{\%} of individuals (of those counted in relative abundance measures using Nmax), a statistic that varies between species. This indicates a need to modify the construction of the equipment for improved fish assemblage size frequency analysis. This is particularly relevant in areas and habitats where seine netting and trawling are not possible. We describe how the system can be modified for optimised usage within low visibility waters and suggest potential uses of the system.},

Among them, Natural User Interfaces (NUI), i.e. non-intrusive technologies not requiring to the user to wear devices nor use external hardware (e.g. keys or trackballs), are considered a promising way to broader the audience of specific cultural heritage domains, like the navigation/interaction with digital artworks presented on wall-sized displays. Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places. Specifically, we let the user to "move the head" as way of natural interaction to explore and navigate through these large digital artworks. To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. {\textcopyright} 2016 for this paper by its authors.

Owing to their relatively heavy cell walls and high nutrient requirements, planktonic diatoms are expected to decrease with climate warming because of reduced nutrient redistribution and increasing sinking velocities. Using a historical dataset, this study shows that diatoms were able to maintain their biovolume with increasing stratification in Lake Tahoe over the last decades; however, the diatom community structure changed. Increased stratification and reduced nitrogen to phosphorus ratios selected for small-celled diatoms, particularly within the Cyclotella genus. An empirical model showed that a shift in phytoplankton species composition and cell size was consistent within different depth strata, indicating that altered nutrient concentrations were not responsible for the change. The increase in small-celled species was sufficient to decrease the average diatom size and thus sinking velocity, which strongly influences energy transfer through the food web and carbon cycling. Our results show that within the diverse group of diatoms, small-sized species with a high surface area to volume ratio were able to adapt to a decrease in mixing intensity, supporting the hypotheses that abiotic drivers affect the size structure of planktonic communities and that warmer climate favours small-sized diatom cells.},

abstract = {The movement of resource subsidies across natural systems can
have important effects on recipient communities and has emerged
as a key research area in ecology. Detrital subsidies are
critical in marine ecosystems where communities are reliant on
external sources of primary production, yet few studies have
quantified the spatial extent of drift algae at coastal scales.
Using observations of the seafloor (up to 140 m depth) from
tow-camera surveys along 145 km of Nova Scotia coast, and
bathymetric data of this region, we created the first predictive
map of drift subsidy in a marine ecosystem. We used a random
forest model to generate our predictions, which correctly
classified 95 {\%} of observations into a presence or absence of
drift. Distance from source, slope, and bathymetric position
index (elevation relative to surrounding landscape) was the main
predictor variables of the occurrence of drift. Drift algae
occurred across a range of benthic habitats within our study
area, but most frequently within 1.4 km of the coast on flat
bottoms or in regions with zero or negative bathymetric position
index. Such areas were coincident with seafloor depressions and
flat low-energy habitats. Repeated observations at some
locations indicated that areas with steep slopes or large
curvature tended to have variable patterns of drift compared to
areas with little or no slope or curvature. We predict that deep
subtidal environments receiving drift subsidy will be impacted
by the declines in kelp biomass projected for this region (and
others) due to changes in ocean climate.},

these countries captured approximately 98{\%} of global landings in
2005. The cost data is categorized into country and gear type
combinations, and this structure allows the cost data to link to
spatially defined catch database for future analysis in both
spatial and temporal dimensions. Costs also varied between gear
types with tuna longliner and dredge being the gears with the
highest variable and total fishing costs. When comparing costs
across FAO regions, Oceania is shown to have the highest unit
variable cost. The global average variable and total cost per
tonne of catch in 2005 is estimated to range between US 608 and
US 1,356 and US 732 and US 1,605, with middle values of US 970

coastal raft-culture area is discussed by field measurement and
a numerical model. The observations show that the vertical
structure changed dramatically. A tidal surface boundary layer
(SBL) is well formed due to the frictional effects induced by
extensive, high-density suspended culture as surface
obstruction. Both the aquaculture drag and the bottom friction
are much higher than those in non-raft-culture areas, and show
an obvious variation with tidal flow. The significant earlier
ebbing and earlier flooding appear in the upper water column
instead of the seabed. And the maximal phase lag is about 1h
within one tide cycle. A 1D hydrodynamic model was modified to
include the SBL and parameterized with the field data. It
replicated the observed velocity profile and was then used to
investigate the impacts of varying culture density and bottom
friction on the vertical tidal-current structure. Modeling
results indicate that the surface current velocity was largely
damped because culture activities enhanced the frictional
effects on flow intensively. The magnitude and vertical
structure of tidal current are determined together with
aquaculture drag and bottom friction. In addition, the vertical
velocity structure has a nonlinear trend along with culture
density and bottom friction. This study is a theoretical
foundation for optimizing aquaculture configuration through
regulating culture density and species distribution.},

In light of climate change and the effects of ﬁre exclusion, single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) ﬁres have become prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at various points in time after one or two high-severity ﬁres. Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single ﬁre, 17 and 18 years after a single ﬁre, 2 and 3 years after a repeat ﬁre (15 year interval between ﬁres), and {\textgreater}100 years since stand-replacement ﬁre (mature/oldgrowth forest). Avian species richness did not differ signiﬁcantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after ﬁre, lowest 2 years after ﬁre, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied signiﬁcantly with habitat type (A = 0.24, P {\textless} 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity ﬁre did not reduce species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval highseverity ﬁres may be important to the conservation of avian biodiversity.},

These rafts provide habitat for a variety of coastal and pelagic fauna. The distances dispersed and the period available for species to utilize these habitats, however, depend on the longevity of the raft and methods for determining the age of rafts are unknown. A method to age drifting M. pyrifera rafts based on a change in length of blades (BL) following detachment is validated here. This technique determines the period of time since detachment and not the actual age of the plant. In general, average BL decreases from initial attached values of 50-60 to about 0 cm, when rafts sink. The rate of aging, or deterioration of BL, is related to water temperature, and sets the period a raft stays afloat. Maximal estimates of ages of rafts were between 63 and 109 days, depending on the exact method used. Their lifetime will limit the distances dispersed by kelp rafts in Southern California, and this methodology will be useful for determining the temporal patterns of abundance of fauna associated with rafts.

increased with increased exposure until a relatively abrupt

copepod found throughout the Arctic Ocean with limited
distributions in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. We
employed molecular techniques to determine the population genetic
structuring of C. glacialis across the boundaries of these 3
oceans. Examination of the DNA sequence of the 16S ribosomal RNA
gene identified 2 predominant haplotypes which defined the Arctic
and North Pacific (Bering Sea) populations. Advection from the
Bering Sea into the Arctic as far as the western Canada Basin was
detected, but C. glacialis from the Bering Sea was absent in the
majority of Arctic Ocean samples. This indicates that C.
glacialis from the Bering Sea was not reproductively established
in the Arctic Ocean. Genetic divergence of Arctic and Bering Sea
populations may have occurred during their isolation in the
course of the Pleistocene glaciations, or, more recently, from
unidirectional advection due to the northward current regime
through the Bering Strait. Climate warming will increase
opportunities for southern organisms to become established in the
Arctic Ocean. The study of intraspecific genetic variation of C.
glacialis has great potential in aiding the early detection of
such ecological change.},

Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful
and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are
documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to
members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The
incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms
confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the
natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west
coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the
South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May,
during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is
associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the
onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated
frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to
be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of
highbiomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from
anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include
those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that
may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small
pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown
tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth
arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass
mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and
other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood
when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by
shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially
lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish
poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish
Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of
PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium
catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally
affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have
been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed
to blooms of A. catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities
in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of
this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the
presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D.
tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to
cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has
been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and
human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to
aerosol toxins produced by this species.},

tools for studying connectivity among marine populations because
they simulate the movement of larvae based on ocean currents and

abstract = {The transformer (tra) gene of Drosophila melanogaster occupies an
intermediate position in the regulatory pathway controlling all
aspects of somatic sexual differentiation. The female-specific
expression of this gene's function is regulated by the Sex lethal
(Sxl) gene, through a mechanism involving sex-specific
alternative splicing of tra pre-mRNA. The tra gene encodes a
protein that is thought to act in conjunction with the
transformer-2 (tra-2) gene product to control the sex-specific
processing of doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA. The bifunctional dsx gene
carries out opposite functions in the two sexes, repressing
female differentiation in males and repressing male
differentiation in females. Here we report the results from an
evolutionary approach to investigate tra regulation and function,
by isolating the tra-homologous genes from selected Drosophila
species, and then using the interspecific DNA sequence
comparisons to help identify regions of functional significance.
The tra-homologous genes from two Sophophoran subgenus species,
Drosophila simulans and Drosophila erecta, and two Drosophila
subgenus species, Drosophila hydei and Drosophila virilis, were
cloned, sequenced and compared to the D. melanogaster tra gene.
This comparison reveals an unusually high degree of evolutionary
divergence among the tra coding sequences. These studies also
highlight a highly conserved sequence within intron one that
probably defines a cis-acting regulator of the sex-specific
alternative splicing event.},

abstract = {As the planet warms, it is important to consider possible
impacts of climate change on severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.
To further that discussion, the current distribution of severe
thunderstorms as a function of large-scale environmental
conditions is presented. Severe thunderstorms are much more
likely to form in environments with large values of convective
available potential energy (CAPE) and deep-tropospheric wind
shear. Tornadoes and large hail are preferred in high-shear
environments and non-tornadic wind events in low shear. Further,
the intensity of tornadoes and hail, given that they occur,
tends to be almost entirely a function of the shear and only
weakly depends on the thermodynamics.Climate model simulations
suggest that CAPE will increase in the future and the wind shear
will decrease. Detailed analysis has suggested that the CAPE
change will lead to more frequent environments favorable for
severe thunderstorms, but the strong dependence on shear for
tornadoes, particularly the strongest ones, and hail means that
the interpretation of how individual hazards will change is open
to question. The recent development of techniques to use
higher-resolution models to estimate the occurrence of storms of
various kinds is discussed. Given the large interannual
variability in environments and occurrence of events, caution is
urged in interpreting the observational record as evidence of

abstract = {We examined the effects of shade from multiple kelp canopy layers (surface Macrocystis pyrifera canopy, understory Pterygophora californica canopy), both individually and in combination, on an understory algal assemblage in a central Californian kelp forest. The removal of both kelp canopies resulted in a dense recruitment of the understory brown alga Desmarestia ligulata that formed a third canopy layer, which significantly decreased bottom light and the abundance of under- story red algae. We subsequently created an additional canopy treatment by removing this third canopy layer. In general, the understory red algae fluctuated seasonally with winter swell intensity, changes in kelp canopy cover, and grazing; and although species richness increased significantly with increased bottom light, red algal bottom cover did not respond significantly to the canopy clear- ings until 2 yr after the canopies were initially cleared. Red algal cover within the Pterygophora canopy treatment was similar to that in the control treatment. In the absence of Pterygophora, the Macrocystis canopy treatment and ‘no canopy' treatment were found to have greater red algal cover and species richness. Individual understory species were rare, which resulted in small effects sizes and thus low statistical power. However, when grouped post hoc, according to how they responded to the canopy clearings (i.e. response groups), we were able to detect canopy treatment effects as much as 1 yr earlier. This method identified that some understory red algae adapted to areas of canopy removal (light-adapted), and others adapted to a variety of light regimes (shade-tolerant). We were able to classify the light-adapted algae into 2 subgroups: the high-light species and the inter- mediate-light species. Although this method of grouping was done post hoc, our results indicate that it may provide the clearest assessment of how understory algae respond to shading from kelp canopies. KEY},

abstract = {Many boring isopods inhabit positively buoyant substrata (wood
and algae), which float after detachment, permitting passive
migration of inhabitants. Based on observations from previous
studies, it was hypothesized that juvenile, subadult and male
isopods migrate actively, and will rapidly abandon substrata
after detachment. In contrast, reproductive females and small
offspring were predicted to remain in floating substrata and
thus have a high probability to disperse passively via rafting.
In order to test this hypothesis, a colonization and an
emigration experiment were conducted with giant kelp
(Macrocystis integrifolia), the holdfasts of which are inhabited
by boring isopods from the genus Limnoria. A survey of benthic
substrata in the kelp forest confirmed that limnoriids inhabited
the holdfasts and did not occur in holdfast-free samples.
Results of the colonization experiment showed that all life
history stages of the boring isopods immigrated into young,
largely uncolonized holdfasts, and after 16 weeks all holdfasts
were densely colonized. In the emigration experiment, all life
history stages of the isopods rapidly abandoned the detached
holdfasts — already 5 min after detachment only few individuals
remained in the floating holdfasts. After this initial rapid
emigration of isopods, little changes in isopod abundance
occurred during the following 24 h, and at the end of the
experiment some individuals of all life history stages still
remained in the holdfasts. These results indicate that all life
history stages of Limnoria participate in both active migration
and passive dispersal. It is discussed that storm-related
dynamics within kelp forests may contribute to intense mixing of
local populations of these burrow-dwelling isopods, and that
most immigrants to young holdfasts probably are individuals
emigrating from old holdfasts detached during storm events. The
fact that some individuals of all life history stages and both
sexes remain in floating holdfasts suggests that limnoriids
could successfully reproduce during rafting journeys in floating
kelp, facilitating long-distance dispersal. We propose that the
coexistence of different modes of dispersal (short distance
local migrations and long-distance regional dispersal) within
these kelp-dwelling isopods might be advantageous in an
environment where unpredictable El Ni{\~{n}}o events can cause
extinction of local kelp forests.},

abstract = {Phlorotannins are polyphenolic brown algal secondary metabolites that can function as herbivore deterrents, digestive inhibitors, and antibacterial agents; thus, they are putative defensive agents against the natural enemies of these algae. Focusing on phlorotannin chemical characteristics alone is not sufficient to explain their activity over a broad geographical range. In particular, it appears that: 1. polyphenolics act with more specificity of activity than initially suggested. 2. the reactivity of polyphenolics is affected by the chemical environment of a herbivore's gut. 3. spatial and temporal variability within a given locality in various environmental parameters (nutrients, irradiance, intensity of herbivory) affects polyphenolic levels. The interaction of these factors has confounded our ability to accurately predict the antiherbivore activity of phlorotannins in plant-herbivore interactions, particularly in the tropical oceans. We assess here the current status of our knowledge of these interactions by reviewing and integrating our understanding of phlorotannin chemical characteristics, function, variability, and potential cost in both temperate and tropical marine systems. We also address the issue of phlorotannin measurement},

We combined field surveys and experimental manipulations to examine the consequences of changing predator diversity for trophic cascades in kelp forests. In field surveys we found that predator diversity was negatively correlated with herbivore abundance and positively correlated with kelp abundance. To assess whether this relationship was causal, we manipulated predator richness in kelp mesocosms, and found that decreasing predator richness increased herbivore grazing, leading to a decrease in the biomass of the giant kelp Macrocystis. The presence of different predators caused different herbivores to alter their behaviour by reducing grazing, such that total grazing was lowest at highest predator diversity. Our results suggest that declining predator diversity can have cascading effects on community structure by reducing the abundance of key habitat-providing species. Keywords},

marine habitats begins almost 11,500 years ago, with the earliest
evidence for shellfish harvesting (11,500 cal BP), intensive kelp
bed fishing (ca. 10,000-8500 cal BP), and Sea Otter hunting (ca.
8900 cal BP) from the Pacific Coast of North America. On San

otters and productive shellfish populations for over 9,000 years,
but the emphasis of shellfish harvesting changed over time.
Knowledge of modern sea otter behavior and ecology suggests that
shell middens dominated by large red abalone shells—relatively
common on San Miguel between about 7,300 and 3,300 years ago—are
only likely to have formed in areas where sea otter populations
had been reduced by Native hunting or other causes. Preliminary
analysis of sea urchin lenses, in which the remains of urchins
are unusually abundant, may also signal an increasing impact of
Island Chumash populations on kelp forest and other near shore
habitats during the late Holocene. Such impacts were probably
relatively limited, however, when compared to the rapid and
severe disruption caused by commercial exploitation under the
Spanish, Mexican, and American regimes of historic times.},

abstract = {Five-year PM10concentrations (2000-05) at Heraklion (urban), Crete, and concurrent measurements of TSP and PM10(2001-02 and 2004-05, respectively) at Finokalia (background) have been used to discriminate between the various sources of PM over the area and investigate the factors that control their levels. PM10concentrations at Heraklion (51±33 $\mu$g m-3) and Finokalia (28±30 $\mu$g m-3) lie within the range found for urban and background-rural sites in the Eastern Mediterranean, respectively. Special focus has been given to the influence of transported dust from N. Africa, which is found to be more frequent during spring and fall. The additional effect from local sources has been also calculated at Heraklion (about 20 $\mu$g m-3). The EU limit of 50 $\mu$g m-3is exceeded at Heraklion, one in 4 days, during winter and spring (50{\%} due to transported dust) and half of the days during summer and fall (pollution). At Finokalia exceedances are observed in winter and spring during one in 5 days, 80-100{\%} of which are associated with dust events. The mass balance estimation for periods with no influence from dust shows that ions dominate the PM10mass (40-60{\%}) with dust and particulate carbonaceous matter (PCM) comprising the rest. During the identified dust outbreaks, the contribution of dust rises to 60-65{\%}, while the contribution of ions declines to 30{\%} and only 10{\%} is PCM. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent surveys of Mediterranean taxa show different patterns from those observed in cold temperate seas, which are characterized by winter dormancy. In the Mediterranean, summer dormancy predominates among taxa and appears to be related to energetic constraints. Temperature and food availability are crucial to the dynamics of benthic suspension feeders. However, because these factors tend to be positively correlated in cold temperate seas, it is difficult to distinguish between their effects. Such correlation does not occur in Mediterranean ecosystems. The contrast between recent studies in the Mediterranean and in other areas can help to disentangle confounded environmental controls.},

These species inhabit rocky reef and foul ground habitats in shallow coastal waters. Many aspects of the biology of this group of spiny lobster species appears to be similar despite their circumglobal geographic range and their taxonomic diversity. Of the six lobster species, only J. lalandii, J. edwardsii and Sagmariasus verreauxi exist as more extensive populations on larger land masses that are all important resources as regional fisheries. The remaining three species, J. caveorum, J. frontalis and J. tristani (the last species is expected to be synonymized with J. paulensis), exist on small isolated oceanic islands and seamounts. In recent years there is new evidence that changes in ocean climate are beginning to show significant impacts on populations of several of the species of these genera. Given the biology of these species, especially their larval biology, it is likely that further change in ocean climate has the potential to greatly affect the production of these lobster species.},

Quantification of this process and the causes behind it have rarely been investigated. This study examines sediment transport by the kelps Durvillaea antarctica and Durvillaea willana in southeast New Zealand. Five beaches near Dunedin were surveyed weekly for 30weeks and all beach-cast kelp was counted and identified; the weight and nature of any attached sediment was also recorded. Additionally, 60 sections of the southeast New Zealand coastline (totaling 130km) were surveyed once and all beach-cast kelp examined. Rocks were found to be attached to 27{\%} of examined holdfasts, usually occurring as a thin veneer. The weight per holdfast ranged from 0.1g to 83kg (with an unusual outlier of 365kg) with a mean weight of 77.1g (SE=15.3, n=1560). Most holdfasts transported less than 100g. Carbonate material occurred on 84{\%} of holdfasts with weights per holdfast ranging from 0.02 to 116.56g with a mean of 7.8g (SE=0.3, n=1695). The character of local rock strongly influences the kelp-mediated flux: South Coast beaches with schist rocks nearby received a significantly greater mean flux (7.49g m2 year-1) than basalt-surrounded Peninsula beaches (mean flux 0.50g m2 year-1). Kelp-transported material provides a small but significant source of sediment to beaches in southeast New Zealand and therefore should be considered when constructing sediment budgets in coastal areas. This study has shown that it is often necessary for geologists to consider biological processes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

predators and identification of their critical habitats and how
these are used are essential to ensuring improved local and
ultimately global white shark protection. In this study we
investigated habitat use by white sharks in False Bay, South
Africa, using acoustic telemetry. 56 sharks (39 female, 17
male), ranging in size from 1.7-5 m TL, were tagged with
acoustic transmitters and monitored on an array of 30 receivers
for 975 days. To investigate the effects of season, sex and size
on habitat use we used a generalized linear mixed effects model.
Tagged sharks were detected in the Bay in all months and across
all years, but their use of the Bay varied significantly with
the season and the sex of the shark. In autumn and winter males
and females aggregated around the Cape fur seal colony at Seal
Island, where they fed predominantly on young of the year seals.
In spring and summer there was marked sexual segregation, with
females frequenting the Inshore areas and males seldom being
detected. The shift from the Island in autumn and winter to the
Inshore region in spring and summer by females mirrors the
seasonal peak in abundance of juvenile seals and of migratory
teleost and elasmobranch species respectively. This study
provides the first evidence of sexual segregation at a fine
spatial scale and demonstrates that sexual segregation in white
sharks is not restricted to adults, but is apparent for
juveniles and sub-adults too. Overall, the results confirm False
Bay as a critical area for white shark conservation as both
sexes, across a range of sizes, frequent the Bay on an annual
basis. The finding that female sharks aggregate in the Inshore
regions when recreational use peaks highlights the need for
ongoing shark-human conflict mitigation strategies.},

These variables included Beggiatoa cover, pellets and faeces, sediment colour, and abundance of flora and fauna. Analysis of the data by multivariate statistics indicated that quantitative data from video recordings can clearly detect major organic enrichment, but that they are not as sensitive as benthic infaunal data to lower levels of disturbance.

In this study we attempted to simulate the Ci conditions of near-shore seawater during the time that seagrasses colonised the sea (in the Cretaceous), and compare the photosynthetic performance of representatives of the 2 plant groups under those versus present day conditions. The results show that the seagrasses have an affinity for Ci at least as high as the algae under the low pH and high CO2/HCO3- concentration ratios simulating near-shore areas of the Cretaceous seas, indicating that their photosynthetic capacity then matched that of macroalgae. However, in the high pH and high CO2/HCO3- ratios of today, their affinity for Ci is lower than that of the macroalgae, and it is suggested that this deficiency renders them a lower ability for Ci utilisation. This situation may possibly be reversed again as global CO2 levels of the atmosphere and, consequently, of near-shore marine habitats increase in the future.},

abstract = {n the high Hawaiian Islands, significant accretion due to coral reef growth is limited by wave exposure and sea level. Holocene coral growth and reef accretion was measured at four stations off Oahu, Hawaii, chosen along a gradient in wave energy from minimum to maximum exposures. The results show that coral growth of living colonies (linear extension) at optimal depths is comparable at all stations (7.7-10.1 mm/y), but significant reef accretion occurs only at wave sheltered stations. At wave sheltered stations in Hanauma Bay and Kaneohe Bay, rates of long term reef accretion are about 2.0 mm/y. At wave exposed stations, off Mamala Bay and Sunset Beach, reef accretion rates are virtually zero in both shallow (1 m) and deeper (optimal) depths (12 m). At wave sheltered stations, such as Kaneohe Bay and Hanauma Bay, Holocene reef accretion is on the order of 10-15 m thick. At wave exposed stations, Holocene accretion is represented by only a thin veneer of living corals resting on antecedent Pleistocene limestone foundations. Modern coral communities in wave exposed environments undergo constant turnover associated with mortality and recruitment or re-growth of fragmented colonies and are rarely thicker than a single living colony. Breakage, scour, and abrasion of living corals during high wave events appears to be the major source of mortality and ultimately limits accretion to wave sheltered environments. Depth is particularly important as a modulator of wave energy. The lack of coral reef accretion along shallow open ocean coastlines may explain the absence of mature barrier reefs in the high Hawaiian Islands.},

was predicted that the interactive effects of high temperature
and UVR suppress algal persistence and reproductive output at
the sea surface. This hypothesis was tested by exposing
Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh sporophytes to two
irradiance (PAR, PAR+UV) and three temperature (cool, ambient,
warm) conditions. An outdoor-tank experiment with two
consecutive runs (1st and 2nd) was conducted in northern-central

Results showed that after being afloat for 15days, algae
physiologically acclimated efficiently to changing abiotic
conditions by a decrease in pigment contents and dynamic
photoinhibition. However, in kelps exposed to 20°C these
acclimation processes operated at the expense of growth,
resulting in reduced biomass gains, lower blade elongation
rates, and diminished reproduction. Overall, floating M.

abstract = {Giant kelp Macrocystispyrifera is the dominant macrophyte along much of the California coast. Each plant is composed of several fronds, each of which can have more than 100 blades. We have developed equations which describe relationships between size and distance which account for variations in frond size and blade node number The most successful descriptions involve the separation of within-frond patterns from between-frond patterns. One useful within-frond description is the relationsh{\~{}}p between the area of blade relative to the largest blade on its frond (e.g. a fractional area of 0.1) as a function of its relative position on the frond (e.g. the blade's node posit{\~{}}on is 0.1 of the total number of nodes from the apex). A useful between-frond description is the relationship between the area of the largest blade on a frond and the frond size. The 2 types of descriptions used together form a compact description of frond morphology that accounts for most of the variability in blade size and position for a range of frond sizes. Similar relationships hold for the distributions of frond lengths within a kelp plant. The morphological relationships are expressed used power series that were fit to the data. The existence of power series relationships describing kelp morphology can be used for modelling studies of such factors as the light field around a plant.},

phenomenon that was limited to a handful of species with
exceptionally low dispersal potential. However, a growing body of
experimental studies indicates that adaptive differentiation
occurs in numerous marine invertebrates in response to selection
imposed by strong gradients (and more complex mosaics) of abiotic
and biotic conditions. Moreover, a surprisingly high proportion
of the marine invertebrates known or suspected of exhibiting
local adaptation are species with planktonic dispersal. Adaptive
divergence among populations can occur over a range of spatial
scales, including those that are fine-grained (i.e., meters to
kilometers), reflecting a balance between scales of gene flow and
selection. Addressing the causes and consequences of adaptive
genetic differentiation among invertebrate populations promises
to advance community ecology, climate change research, and the

The studies that run controls typically use them to calculate a constant "correction factor," which is subtracted prior to formal data analysis. This procedure constitutes a non-rigorous suppression of variance that overstates the statistical significance of observed differ- ences. The appropriate statistical analysis for preference tests with two foods is usually a simple t-test performed on the between-food differences in loss of mass (or numbers, area, etc.) comparing the results of experimentals with consumers to controls without consumers. Application of this recommended test procedure to an actual data set illustrates how low replication in controls, which is typical of most studies of feeding preference, inhibits detection of an apparently large influence of previous mechanical dam- age (simulated grazing) in reducing the attractiveness of a brown alga to a sea urchin.},

abstract = {Management and conservation of ecosystems relies on biodiversity data; however, broad-scale biological data are often limited. Predictive modelling using environmental variables has recently proven a valuable tool in addressing this gap. Wave exposure is a particularly important environmental variable that structures shallow reef systems, but it is rarely quantified across the large areas often used for predictive studies. Therefore, we investigated approaches that quantify exposure and can be readily applied across a large area. We generated 6 quantitative indices that emphasise different aspects of exposure using a numerical wave model and cartographic fetch mod- els. The utility of these indices for predictive modelling in shallow temperate reef systems was assessed by how well they explained community and genera-level algal patterns in Tasmania, Aus- tralia, which is a region that experiences a wide range of wave exposure conditions. Exposure indices were significant predictors of algal patterns, explaining up to 18{\%} of community level patterns and up to 37{\%} of the variance associated with the occurrence and cover of algal genera. Fetch-based indices in particular appear to be a viable option for quantifying exposure on shallow reefs. These indices can be generated within a Geographic Information System (GIS) program for specific sites of interest, along coastlines or on a grid, and are potentially accessible to ecologists. Quantification of exposure across broad regions using fetch indices will allow ecologists to makes advances in predic- tive modelling studies, but also facilitate studies that test the generality of hypotheses and mecha- nisms driving patterns previously observed using qualitative measures.

Exploitation of the kelp habitat by the fauna, and the ways in which habitat size and seasonal variations a¡ect the kelp fauna community were analysed. The study focused on mobile macrofauna, of which 238 species were found on 56 kelps sampled, with an average density of almost 8000 individuals per kelp. Amphipods and gastropods were the most diverse and abundant fauna groups. The species composition was di¡erent on the lamina, stipe (with epiphytic algae) and holdfast. A similar pattern of epiphyte- and holdfast-fauna composition was found for all regions. Lowest diversity and abundance were found on the lamina, and highest diversity in the holdfast. Highest abundance was found on the stipe in summer, but there were large variations between sites and seasons, from a few individuals to more than 80 000 animals per stipe. Neither seasonal changes nor variation in habitat volume a¡ected the number of species signi¢cantly, but abundance was signi¢cantly related to season and habitat volume.

abstract = {Since its introduction to Nova Scotia in the early 1990s, the invasive green alga Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides has spread rapidly to become a dominant and persistent component of seaweed assemblages in the rocky subtidal zone. To examine the potential of sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) to regulate Codium, and the potential of the alga to support urchin growth and reproduction, we fed urchins Codium and/or kelp (Laminaria spp., a high quality and preferred native food) in the laboratory for 11 months. Urchins showed a strong and active preference for kelp: they consumed more Laminaria than Codium (as dry weight) in single and mixed diet treatments. Urchins fed only Codium consumed 3.5 times more of the alga than those on a mixed diet, but did not increase their feeding rate in winter when kelp consumption was greatest. Laminaria was consumed at the same rate in single and mixed diets, indicating that the presence of an alternative food had no effect on kelp consumption. Survival and growth (change in test diameter) were lowest on the Codium diet, although the differences among diets were not statistically significant. Urchins on the Codium diet showed no gonadal production over the annual reproductive cycle, compared to a marked rise in gonad index on the Laminaria and mixed diets. Our results indicate that Codium is an unattractive, unpalatable and poor quality food, which is not readily consumed by urchins. Thus we predict that urchins at moderate densities will be much more likely to graze kelp than Codium in mixed stands, creating a mosaic of Codium patches and barren areas. At high densities, however, urchins are likely to destructively graze all seaweeds, although dense stands of the invasive alga may prolong the widespread formation of barrens.},

abstract = {Warming could strongly stabilize or destabilize populations and
food webs by changing the interaction strengths between predators
and their prey. Predicting the consequences of warming requires
understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and
metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature
dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments
with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this
data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism)
and per capita interac- tion strengths in the short and long
term. Additionally,we investigated if and how body mass changes
these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming
increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature
effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion
efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in
all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the
one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could
increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less
fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing
ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks
because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per
capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which
suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations,
i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium
density after a small perturbation. Together, these results
suggest that warming has complex and potentially profound effects
on predatorprey interactions and food-web stability.},

global distribution of wind sea energy is highly affected by the

coastal reef system. Overall population size remained relatively
stable over a 3 yr study period. Marked differences in density,
sex ratio and size frequency of spiny lobsters occurred between
depths on the reef over a horizontal scale of 300 m. These
differences varied seasonally and were related to moulting,
reproductive and feeding cycles. They were not directly Linked to
fluctuations in sea surface temperature, sea surge or
photoperiod. Similar annual trends occurred at other sites.
Highest densities of females in shallow ({\textless} 10 m) water coincided
with moulting in May. Males moved inshore only briefly to moult
in October-November often with no concomitant increase in male
density in shallow ({\textless} 10 m) water. Increases in density of
females at the deep (25 m) seaward edge of the coastal reef
occurred during the egg-bearing period. In summer (December,
January) the density of large males at a deep patch reef (25 to
30 m) increased. These males foraged nocturnally for bivalves on
the surroundmg sand flat. Resighting of tagged individuals
confirmed that the observed fluctuations in density, sex ratio
and size frequency of spiny lobsters at different depths were
caused by males and females moving inshore-offshore at different
times of the year.},

as the surface elevation in a random sea) that is `weakly
non-linear'. In the first approximation the distribution is
Gaussian, as is well known. In higher approximations it is shown
that the distribution is given by successive sums of a
Gram–Charlier series; not quite in the form that has sometimes
been used as an empirical fit for observed distributions, but in
a modified form due to Edgeworth.It is shown that the cumulants
of the distribution are much simpler to calculate than the
corresponding moments; and the approximate distributions are in
fact derived by inversion of the cumulant-generating
function.The theory is applied to random surface waves on water.
The third cumulant and hence the skewness of the distribution of
surface elevation is evaluated explicity in terms of the
directional energy spectrum. It is shown that the skewness $\lambda$3 is
generally positive, and positive upper and lower bounds for $\lambda$3
are derived. The theoretical results are compared with some
measurements made by Kinsman (1960).It is found that for free,
undamped surface waves the skewness of the distribution of
surface slopes is of a higher order than the skewness of the
surface elevation. Hence the observed skewness of the slopes may
be a sensitive indicator of energy transfer and dissipation

abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated that understory kelps altered rates of mass and particulate transport beneath kelp canopies. This study examined the implications of these physical effects, plus shading by canopies, on the recruitment of four taxa of benthic invertebrates. Using field manipulations of understory kelp density and substratum orientation, we examined the effect of kelps on invertebrate recruitment and assessed the mechanisms involved. These mechanisms included reduced flow, increased sedimentation, reduced light intensity and reduced microalgal cover. All effects were significant to recruitment, but their relative importance varied among taxa. Two species examined, the serpulid polychaete Pseudochitinopoma occidental (Bush) and the cheilostome bryozoan Membranipora membranacea (Linnaeus) have long-lived planktonic larvae. Kelp canopies significantly affected recruitment of these two species, but in different ways. Pseudochitinopoma recruitment was reduced by sedimentation and light but was unaffected by ambient flow directly. Recruitment of Membranipora exhibited patterns consistent with that of passive transport of larvae with higher recruitment in high flow, no-kelp environments. Its recruitment was reduced by higher sedimentation beneath canopies, but showed no response to changes in light intensity. Spirorbid polychaetes have short planktonic phases of unknown durations. Kelps significantly affected their recruitment but difference in recruitment rates between kelp-covered and exposed substrata varied in direction with season. Spirorbid recruitment was reduced by light and high levels of sedimentation, but their recruitment patterns were unaffected by ambient flow directly. The cyclostome bryozoan Tubulipora sp. has a very short planktonic period (seconds to minutes) and factors affecting its recruitment were consequently difficult to decipher. It apparently responded negatively to higher light intensity and increased sedimentation. The effects of kelp canopies on recruitment depend on the complex interaction of these variables. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {Arctic areas of deep-water convection have a large potential for
export of organic carbon from surface waters into the deep sea
and, therefore, are an important part of the global carbon
cycle. As the Arctic is reportedly heating up faster than any
other part of the planet, temperature-driven changes in the
biogeochemical cycling in these areas can be very significant.
Here, we study the regulation of bacterial carbon metabolism,
which process vast amounts of organic carbon, by temperature and
the availability of resources. The response of bacterial
production and respiration of natural bacterial assemblages from
the Fram Strait was studied by experimental manipulations of
temperature and resources in combination. Both bacterial
production and respiration were enhanced by temperature so that
the total bacterial carbon demand increased sixfold following a
temperature increase of 6°C. Respiration responded more strongly
than production so that bacterial growth efficiency decreased
with increasing temperature. Although neither production nor
respiration was limited by resource availability under in situ
conditions, the response to temperature was higher in
resource-amended treatments, indicative of a
substrate-temperature interaction regulating both components of
bacterial metabolism. In conclusion, the results show that
warming can result in a substantial increase of the carbon flow
through bacteria and that most of the carbon consumed would be
released as CO2. Moreover, the results suggest that both
temperature and availability of resources need to be considered
to accurately be able to predict changes in bacterial carbon
metabolism in response to climate change.},

Although designed as a technical demonstration for land applications, Hyperion was tested for its capabilities over a range of water targets in Eastern Australia, including Moreton Bay in southern Queensland. Moreton Bay was the only Australian Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion coastal site used for calibration/validation activities. This region was selected due to its spatial gradients in optical depth, water quality, bathymetry, and substrate composition. A combination of turbid and humic river inputs, as well as the open ocean flushing, determines the water quality of the bay. The field campaigns were coincident with Hyperion overpasses, retrieved inherent optical properties, apparent optical properties, substrate reflectance spectra, and water quality parameters. Environmental noise calculations demonstrate that Hyperion has sufficient sensitivity to detect optical water quality concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll, and suspended matter in the complex waters of Moreton Bay. A methodology was developed integrating atmospheric and hydrooptical radiative transfer models (MODTRAN-4, Hydrolight) to estimate the underwater light field. A matrix inversion method was applied to retrieve concentrations of chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter, and suspended matter, which were comparable to those estimated in the field on the days of the overpass.},

abstract = {Net primary production (NPP) is influenced by disturbance-driven fluctuations in foliar standing crop (FSC) and resource-driven fluctuations in rates of recruitment and growth, yet most studies of NPP have focused primarily on factors influencing growth. We quantified NPP, FSC, recruitment, and growth rate for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, at three kelp forests in southern California, U.S.A., over a 54-month period and determined the relative roles of FSC, recruitment, and growth rate in contributing to variation in annual NPP. Net primary production averaged between 0.42 and 2.38 kg dry mass x m(-2) x yr(-1) at the three sites. The initial FSC present at the beginning of the growth year and the recruitment of new plants during the year explained 63{\%} and 21{\%} of the interannual variation observed in NPP, respectively. The previous year's NPP and disturbance from waves collectively accounted for 80{\%} of the interannual variation in initial FSC. No correlation was found between annual growth rate (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit of existing kelp mass) and annual NPP (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit area of ocean bottom), largely because annual growth rate was consistent compared to initial FSC and recruitment, which fluctuated greatly among years and sites. Although growth rate was a poor predictor of variation in annual NPP, it was principally responsible for the high mean values observed for NPP by Macrocystis. These high mean values reflected rapid growth (average of approximately 2{\%} per day) of a relatively small standing crop (maximum annual mean = 444 g dry mass/m2) that replaced itself approximately seven times per year. Disturbance-driven variability in FSC may be generally important in explaining variation in NPP, yet it is rarely examined because cycles of disturbance and recovery occur over timescales of decades or more in many systems. Considerable insight into how variation in FSC drives variation in NPP may be gained by studying systems such as giant kelp forests that are characterized by frequent disturbance and rapid rates of growth and recruitment.},

benefits from on-farm seaweed production and it will probably be
a part of future expansion of the abalone industry. Abalone waste

in environmental metabolomics over the past decade. This growth
can be attributed to the comprehensive and rapid nature of
nontargeted metabolomics and the ability to generate hypotheses
involving complex environmental stressors, especially when the
mode of action is unknown. Using a wide variety of model
organisms, metabolomic studies have detected stress from abiotic
factors such as xenobiotic exposure and temperature shifts as
well as biotic stressors such as herbivory and competition.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics has been the
dominant analytical platform used for environmental metabolo-

preparation. However, the number of mass spectrometry (MS)-based
metabolomic studies is also increasing rapidly, owing to its high
sensitivity for the detection of trace levels of metabolites. In

design, extraction methods, analytical instrumentation, and
statistical methods used in environmental metabolomics. We then
highlight some of the recent studies that have used metabo-
lomics to elucidate hitherto unknown biochemical modes of actions
of various environmental stressors to both terrestrial and

abstract = {The aim of the presented investigation was to test the sensibility of macroalgal aquaculture in offshore wind farms in the North Sea and to find arguments for the choice of appropriate sites among the planned wind farms. Based on experience with an offshore aquaculture farm of Laminaria saccharina conducted in 2002, we assessed the maximum hydrodynamic forces affecting farmed algae by applying the model software "WaveLoad". Drag measured in a towing tank was considerably higher on algae with a more ruffled margin and wider blade collected from sheltered environments than on flat and narrow farmed Laminaria despite comparable blade areas. Drag varied according to frond size, current velocity and acceleration reaction. Dislodgement of laminarian holdfasts and the forces necessary to break the stipe depended on blade length and surface area. Neither did our measured nor our calculated values of drag exceed those forces, provided the algae had been grown in a current {\textgreater} 1 m s-1. Even in storm conditions with maximum current velocities of 1.52 m s-1and wave heights of up to 6.4 m can cultivated L. saccharina withstand the high energy environment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It has been proposed that the mechanical flexibility of many waver-swept$\backslash$norganisms reduces the hydrodynamic forces imposed on these plants$\backslash$nand animals. For example, reorientation of the organism can render$\backslash$nit more streamlined, and by "going with the flow" a flexible organism$\backslash$ncan reduce the relative velocity between itself and the surrounding$\backslash$nwater, thereby reducing drag and lift. Motion of the body allows$\backslash$nthe organism to gain momentum, however, and this momentum can apply$\backslash$nan inertial force when the organism's motion is slowed by the deformation$\backslash$nof the body's supporting structures. Through a series of mathematical$\backslash$nmodels we show that the inertial forces imposed on flexible plants$\backslash$nand animals can be large enough to increase the overall force on$\backslash$nthe organism, more than offsetting the advantages of moving with$\backslash$nthe flow. A dimensionless index, the jerk number, is proposed as$\backslash$na tool for prdicting when inertial forces will be important, and$\backslash$nthe utility of this index is explored through an examination of the$\backslash$nforces applied to kelps and mussels. The tendency for inertial loading$\backslash$nto peak at certain frequencies raises the possibility that the structure$\backslash$nof organisms can be tuned (either by evolution or physiological response)$\backslash$nto avoid potentially damaging loads.},

abstract = {Wave-swept macroalgae are subjected to large hydrodynamic forces as each wave breaks on shore, loads that are repeated thousands of times per day. Previous studies have shown that macroalgae can easily withstand isolated impositions of maximal field forces. Nonetheless, macroalgae break frequently. Here we investigate the possibility that repeated loading by sub-lethal forces can eventually cause fracture by fatigue. We determine fracture toughness, in the form of critical strain energy release rate, for several flat-bladed macroalgae, thereby assessing their resistance to complete fracture in the presence of cracks. Critical energy release rates are evaluated through single-edge-notch, pull-to-break tests and single-edge-notch, repeated-loading tests. Crack growth at sub-critical energy release rates is measured in repeated-loading tests, providing a first assessment of algal breakage under conditions of repeated loading. We then estimate the number of imposed waves required for un-notched algal blades to reach the point of complete fracture. We find that, if not checked by repair, fatigue crack growth from repeated sub-lethal stresses may completely fracture individuals within days. Our results suggest that fatigue may play an important role in macroalgal breakage.},

@article{Haring2007,
abstract = {Photosynthesis, growth, distribution, and persistence of macroalgae are determined in part by the physical environment in which they live. Therefore, discerning how macroalgae interact with their physical environment is necessary to better understand their physiological performance. The purpose of this study was to examine what photosynthetic and hydrodynamic costs and benefits the morphology of Pachydictyon coriaceum (Phaeophyta) confers on the thallus in a given environment. Principal components analysis of morphometric measurements of Pachydictyon coriaceum from different flow habitats and depths separated thalli into three distinct morphs: shallow wave-exposed, shallow wave-protected, and deep. To test the hypothesis that thallus morphology affects net photosynthesis (NP), thalli of three morphotypes of P. coriaceum were incubated in an enclosed recirculating flume under three simulated light/water flow environments representing conditions from which the three morphotypes were collected. The wave-protected and deep morphs had significantly higher rates of photosynthesis than the wave-exposed morph for all three simulated environments. The dense, compact shape of the wave-exposed morph readily streamlines with flow and in doing so, potentially shades many of its internal blades likely accounting for its lower biomass-specific NP. Drag coefficients (Cd) were estimated for the three morphotypes over a range of flow velocities between 0.08 and 0.47 m s-1. At lower water flow velocities (0.08-0.21 m s-1), wave-exposed morphs had the lowest Cd among the three morphotypes. But drag coefficients of the three morphotypes converged with increasing flow velocities, and at velocities {\textgreater}0.31 m s-1 there were no differences in Cd among the three morphotypes. The results of this study indicate that the environmentally-shaped morphs influence photosynthesis and, to a lesser degree, hydrodynamic forces acting on P. coriaceum. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

The paper presents the different components of the AWARE platform and the scenario in which the multi-UAV missions were carried out. The missions described in this paper include surveillance with multiple UAVs, sensor deployment and fire threat confirmation. In order to avoid redundancies, instead of describing the operation of the full architecture for every mission, only non-overlapping aspects are highlighted in each one. Key issues in multi-UAV systems such as distributed task allocation, conflict resolution and plan refining are solved in the execution of the missions.},

@article{Macarthur1992,
abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors oflarge ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

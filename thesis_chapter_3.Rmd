# Introduction

Importance of kelp rafting as a dispersal mechanism

Discuss previous rafting studies and the gaps within them
Identify important coeffients

> Bouyancy (Net)
> Drag and resistance
> Effect of wind on surface currents/waves 
> Stokes drift
> Wind and swell direction
> Direct effect of wind on kelp
> Dispersal scale

Highlight the gaps and explain how current study will address gaps

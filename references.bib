abstract = {Water flow is a strong determinant of kelp growth, but it is also a stress factor causing breakage and dislodgement. As wave exposure and currents differ with respect to flow pattern, the 2 forces are expected to affect kelp morphology differently. We investigated how wave exposure and current speed interact and influence kelp Laminaria hyperborea morphology. We sampled thalli from 27 stations on the Midwest coast of Norway and recorded age, and length- and strength-related characters. We found that high wave exposure and current speed influenced holdfast biomass and stipe thickness. Wave exposure had, overall, a stronger effect than current speed. An increase in current speed seemed to have a considerable effect at low wave exposure levels, but the relationship weakened at high wave exposure levels. The length-related (‘go with the flow') characters thallus and stipe length were influenced by wave induced water flow but not by current speed. Differences in wave exposure and current speed had very weak influences on lamina biomass and length. Thus, the proportion of the thallus being lamina was high in the most sheltered areas and decreased as the wave exposure increased. Our study suggests that the strong, orbital and stochastic mode of wave exposure has a different and stronger effect as a stressor than the more regular and bidirectional stress caused by currents.},

abstract = {Overfishing and human-induced climate change are putting severe pressure on marine ecosystems. In the southern Benguela, most of South Africa's commercial fisheries have a long history of exploitation and this, coupled with spatio-temporal changes in key species over the last three decades has severely impacted some of South Africa's fisheries and ecosystems. This review summarizes these spatio-temporal changes and investigates possible drivers thereof. It incorporates both past and current research, with a large portion of the latter having formed part of the University of Cape Town's Ma-Re BASICS (Marine Research in the Benguela and Agulhas Systems for supporting Interdisciplinary Climate-change Science) 2010-2013 program. Almost all described changes involve a temporal decline or a spatial shift in species. Fishing seems to have played a role in many of the observed stock declines, for example through geographically disproportionate catches in relation to stock distribution. In some cases, changes in the physical environment seem to have played an additional role, e.g., rock lobsters on the west coast have been affected by fishing as well as changes in the physical environment. In almost all cases these changes have taken place since the 1980s/1990s, except for one or two resources, which have experienced declines since at least the mid 20th century. Spatial shifts in species have either involved an eastward expansion of cool-water species, including kelps, rock lobster and pelagic fish, or a retraction of warm-water species such as the brown mussel, suggesting a cooling of inshore waters along the south-west coast since the 1980s. This suggested cooling is revealed in ocean temperature (SST Pathfinder), wind and upwelling data for the Cape Peninsula and south-west coast region during the same period. The absence or inconsistency of long-term data is problematic when trying to identify drivers of ecosystem change, and actual ecosystem change itself. We discuss this using ocean temperature in the southern Benguela as an example. In addition, the complex interplay between climate and anthropogenic (notably fishing) drivers makes identification of drivers difficult and disentangling these combined effects will require interdisciplinary collaboration, co-ordinated ecosystem projects, increased modelling effort and the continuation, but also establishment, of new, long-term monitoring studies.},

abstract = {Despite their ecological and economic importance, no summary of kelp global biogeography has been produced for almost two decades. The circumscription of the order Laminariales and familial and generic relationships in the group have changed considerably recently, in the light of molecular data. A global summary and geographical analysis of kelp species and their distributions (112 species in 33 genera) is presented. These data are analysed and discussed from the perspective of the new consensus of relationships within the group, and likely evolutionary events. The putative ancestors of the kelps occur and are overwhelmingly most diverse, in the cooler waters of northern Japan. The biogeographical evidence suggests three main lines of subsequent evolution: (a) a diversification producing the four ‘derived' families Alariaceae, Costariceae, Laminariaceae, and Lessoniaceae and most extant genera in the temperate northern Pacific, probably during the Miocene. (b) The evolution of an Arctic flora which invaded the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering Strait ca. 5.5 Ma. (c) At least four separate crossings, by different genera, of tropical regions from Northern to Southern Hemisphere (and one in the opposite direction). The recorded impacts of man on these distributions have thus far been minimal, with the notable exceptions of Undaria pinnatifida and species of Saccharina (grown in aquaculture systems for human food). Most genera are monospecific, with many confined to either the western or eastern temperate North Pacific, whereas the distribution of the most species-rich genera (Alaria, Laminaria, Saccharina) includes the Arctic, and they are widespread in the North Atlantic. This rapid species-level evolution is hypothesised to have been promoted by the relatively recent invasion of the Atlantic by these taxa. The crossing of the tropics has occurred in warm-temperate species some of which occur and are sometimes abundant, in deeper water in today's tropics, refuting the widespread view that kelps are only present in cold-water habitats. Most of these Southern Hemisphere kelps are in the family Lessoniaceae, including the only genus not present in the Northern Hemisphere, Lessonia. The origins of this genus are unclear. Knowledge of the phylogeography of the Ecklonia/Eisenia complex is particularly important in understanding Southern Hemisphere kelp biogeography. A number of groups are undergoing active speciation and, with the lack of a consistent species concept, the species-level taxonomy of the group remains to be clarified. There is a great need for molecular phylogeographical studies to provide evidence for many of the hypotheses presented here based on distributional evidence and the currently accepted taxonomic framework.},

We used two measures of thermal shifts from analyses of global temperatures over the past 50 years to describe the pace of climate change that species should track: the velocity of climate change (geographic shifts of isotherms over time) and the shift in seasonal timing of temperatures. Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes, despite slower ocean warming. These indices give a complex mosaic of predicted range shifts and phenology changes that deviate from simple poleward migration and earlier springs or later falls. They also emphasize potential conservation concerns, because areas of high marine biodiversity often have greater velocities of climate change and seasonal shifts.},

for understanding the environmental drivers of ecosystem
dynamics. We assessed the role of several environmental drivers
in explaining temporal and spatial patterns in the abundance of
giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera in the Santa Barbara Channel
between 1984 and 2009. We developed a novel method for estimating
the canopy biomass of giant kelp from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper
satellite imagery, which allowed us to examine the dynamics of
giant-kelp biomass on spatial scales ranging from 100s of m 2 to
100s of km 2 and temporal scales ranging from several weeks to 25
yr. Comparisons of changes in canopy biomass with oceanographic
and climatic data revealed that winter losses of regional kelp
canopy biomass were positively correlated with significant wave
height (r 2 = 0.50), while spring recoveries were negatively
correlated with sea surface temperature (r 2 = 0.30; used as a
proxy for nutrient availability). On interannual timescales,
regional kelp-canopy biomass lagged the variations in wave
heights, sea surface temperatures, and the North Pacific Gyre
Oscillation index by 3 yr, indicating that these factors affect
cycles of kelp recruitment and mortality. Results from cluster
analysis showed that the response of kelp biomass to
environmental conditions varied among different subregions of the
Santa Barbara Channel. The dynamics of kelp biomass in exposed
regions were related to wave disturbance, while kelp dynamics in
sheltered regions tracked sea surface temperatures more closely.
These results depict a high level of regional heterogeneity in
the biomass dynamics of this important foundation species. ¬{\textcopyright}

abstract = {The shallow subtidal rocky habitats in most temperate coastal areas are con- spicuously dominated by large brown algae in the orders Laminariales and Fucales. These algae are commonly referred to as kelps, although the term technically refers to Laminariales only. Their high productivity and com- plicated biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities. For this reason, these communities havc received a great deal of research, including one of the first scientific applications of diving (128). This review summarizes the status of research programs operating within very different scales and emphasizes the point that a real understanding of the processes under study must come from the proper perspective and integration of the other levels. A taxonomic account of the world's kelps is far too complex for the scope of this review, but Mann (146) has characterized the world's kelp forests by their dominant genera. Laminaria species are found in many parts of the world but dominate both sides of the Atlantic and the coasts of China and Japan. Ecklonia dominates some kelp forests in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and a few other southern hemisphere localities. The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forms dense tbrests in many parts of the world including areas of the northeast Pacific, the southern shores of South America, many Southern Ocean islands, and isolated areas of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Macrocystis pyriJora does not occur in the eastern Pacific area north of San Francisco, California; however, this northern region has the highest species diversity of kelps in the world (63), with Macrocystis integrifolia and Nereocystis, Alaria, Pterygophora, and Laminaria, among other conspicuous genera. *The US Government has the right to retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license in and to any copyright covering this paper. 215 Annual Reviews www.annualreviews.org/aronline 216 DAYTON Annu.

The life cycle of all kelps consists of an alternation of generations between microscopic haploid gametophytes and large diploid sporophytes which pro- dhce reproductive sori, often on specialized sporophylls. Reduction division occurs in the sporangium, producing microscopic zoospores which are released to settle on the bottom and develop into male and female gametophytes. Gametophytes produce antheridia and oogonia; fertilization results in zygote formation and the growth of sporophytes. Most ecological studies have focused on the large sporophyte stage; however, recent work emphasizes the different threshold factors important to the separate life-history stages, especially the gametophytes and juvenile stages (50, 205). This review is possible because the huge and often rather diffuse literature has received excellent reviews (21, 80, 119, 146, 158, 183, 205). ! will emphasize the kelp community models being developed in the northeastern Pacific because of my own familiarity with the system.

abstract = {The detection of trends in ecosystems depends upon (1) a good
description of the foundation or benchmark against which changes
are measured and (2) a distinction between natural and
anthropogenic changes. Patterns and mechanisms observed over 25
years in a large kelp forest suggest that definition of a
meaningful benchmark is impossible, because many of the large
animals have been gone for years to decades, and kelps are
sensitive to large-scale, low-frequency El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern
Oscillation events and longer term regime shifts. A shift in the
oceanographic climate has significantly reduced the average size
and carrying capacity of the dominant plant. The animals that
have been functionally removed from the community include sea
otters, black sea bass, yellowtail, white sea bass, and abalones.
Other species are still present, but fisheries have had huge
effects on the abundances, size–frequencies, and/or spatial
distributions of sheephead, kelp bass, rays, flatfish, rock fish,
spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even sea cucumbers,
crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated fishing. The
plants continue to exist without a hint of the effects of the
loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the
megafauna have been removed with very little documentation or
historical understanding of what the natural community was like.
Thus, our ability to separate anthropogenic impacts from the
``natural'' dynamics of the system is severely compromised. We
discuss the importance of both an ecosystem focus on productivity
and careful monitoring of as many populations as possible. In
addition, we show that this community is not tightly integrated
with mutual dependencies; hence, many species can be removed

abstract = {This paper integrates long-term descriptive and experimental studies of the effects of ocean climate on inter- and intraspecific competition, as expressed by recruitment, density, survivorship, growth, and reproduction of the most conspicuous kelp species in the Point Loma kelp forest community off San Diego, California, USA. The species included Macrocystis pyrifera, with a floating canopy; Pterygophora californica and Eisenia arborea, which rely on stipes to support their canopy; Laminaria farlowii, with a prostrate canopy; and a speciose red algal turf. To evaluate the roles of large-scale oceanographic processes on biological processes across important depth gradients, the study was carried out over nine years during a cold-water, nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a event (1988–1989) and a warm-water, nutrient-stressed El Nin ˜o period (1992–1994), over a depth range of 8–23 m. This depth range encompassed strong physical gradients involving factors that are critical for kelp growth, including bottom temperatures (correlated with nutrients) and light levels. To examine interactions among these kelps, we established clearings across the depth gradient and then manipulated Macrocystis recruit densities. The demographic responses offer an understanding of the ``fundamental'' vs. ``realized'' niches of these species. Eval- uating these patterns, as they are influenced by inter- and intraspecific competition, offers insights into the ``realized niches'' of the kelps. With the exception of some understory effects on Macrocystis recruitment and some evidence of intraspecific competition during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a conditions, we found little influence of competitive effects on Macrocystis. The response of Pterygophora to manipulations and disturbances suggests light-limited recruitment, and competition with Macrocystis was exhibited via reduced growth and reproduction, but not survivorship. No nutrient stress was observed in Ptery- gophora reproduction. Eisenia recruitment is rare, but once established, juveniles had very good survivorship, with growth and reproduction reduced by depth; the Macrocystis treat- ment was more important than depth, suggesting the importance of light to Eisenia re- cruitment and growth. In general, Macrocystis had massive effects on Laminaria growth and reproduction, the strength varying with depth. In particular, there were very strong effects of competition with Macrocystis during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a period when Macrocystis had a dense surface canopy. In addition to the Macrocystis effects, there were some significant Pterygophora effects on Laminaria growth during El Nin ˜o. The strongest biological definition of realized niches occurred during the nutrient-rich La Nin ˜a period, especially in shallow depths. One of the most important conclusions of this paper is the appreciation of the importance of scaling in time to include oceanographic climate. There are many seasonal patterns, but the interannual scales that encompass El Nin ˜os and La Nin ˜as, and ultimately the interdecadal-scale oceanographic regime shifts that affect the intensity of canopy competition with Macrocystis, are critical for this system because surface-water nutrients have pervasive long-term effects on the other kelps. Small- scale patterns are driven by local processes (competition, disturbance, dispersal, etc.) that potentially are important at larger scales; however, our most lasting effects result from very large-scale, low-frequency episodic changes in nutrients, with cascading competitive con- sequences to the other algal populations in the community.

Individuals with increased flexibility and decreased strength were more likely to survive the duration of our study, although this effect was more pronounced in individuals with smaller holdfasts. Increased frond strength was also associated with a reduction in self-thinning, potentially explaining the observed increase in whole-plant mortality with increasing frond strength. * Results from this study demonstrate that variation in tissue mechanical properties among conspecifics can influence survivorship and this may have important evolutionary implications.},

forces imposed by extreme water velocities. Nonetheless, they
seldom have a shape that appears streamlined and they are
constructed of weak, compliant materials. How do they survive?
The answer is complex, but a coherent story is beginning to
emerge. The combined effect of frond shape and material
properties ensures that algae are flexible. In small
individuals, flexibility allows the plant to reorient and
reconfigure in flow, thereby assuming a streamlined shape and
reducing the applied hydrodynamic force. In large individuals,
flexibility allows fronds to 'go with the flow', a strategy that
can at times allow the plant to avoid hydrodynamic forces but
may at other times impose inertial loads. Our understanding of
algal mechanics is such that we can begin to predict the
survivorship of algae as a function of size, spatial
distribution and wave climate.},

abstract = {Marine algae rely on currents and waves to replenish the nutrients required for photosynthesis. The interaction of algal blades with flow often involves dynamic reorientations of the blade surface (pitching and flapping) that may in turn affect nutrient flux. As a first step toward understanding the consequences of blade motion, we explore the effect of oscillatory pitching on the flux to a flat plate and to two morphologies of the kelp Eisenia arborea. In slow flow (equivalent to a water velocity of 2.7 cm s(-1)), pitching increases the time-averaged flux to both kelp morphologies, but not to the plate. In fast flow (equivalent to 20 cm s(-1) in water), pitching has negligible effect on flux regardless of shape. For many aspects of flux, the flat plate is a reliable model for the flow-protected algal blade, but predictions made from the plate would substantially underestimate the flux to the flow-exposed blade. These measurements highlight the complexities of flow-related nutrient transport and the need to understand better the dynamic interactions among nutrient flux, blade motion, blade morphology, and water flow.},

exposed shores in the Gulf of Maine, USA, is co-dominated by two
species of red macroalgae, Chondrus crispus Stackhouse and
Mastocarpus stellatus (Stack. in With.) Guiry. These species are
anatomically, morphologically, ecologically and phylogenetically
similar. We quantified: 1. (1) mechanical properties of the
stipe; and 2. (2) flow forces on the stipe relative to thallus
area and biomass of these species, to determine mechanical and
morphological characteristics that could explain the greater
winter dislodgement of C. crispus thalli in mixed stands.
Although stipes of both species broke at the same mean force, C.
crispus stipes were relatively thick, weak and extensible
compared to the relatively thin, strong and stiff stipes of M.
stellatus. Risk of breakage increased with size in both species
because: 1. (1) their stipes weakened with increasing
cross-sectional area; and 2. (2) cross-sectional area of the
stipe failed to increase in linear proportion to frond area. Drag
on C. crispus thalli of {\textgreater} 3 g fresh weight was greater than on M.
stellatus of the same biomass, whereas drag on smaller fronds ( {\textless}
3 g fresh weight) of the two species was similar. Drag on large
C. crispus thalli was greater mainly because they exhibit greater
surface area for a given biomass than do large M. stellatus.
Dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces has more severe ecological
consequences for M. stellatus because regeneration from holdfasts
is slower than in C. crispus. A reduced surface area:biomass
ratio coupled with greater strength may lessen wave-induced
disturbance and be important to maintaining a high abundance of
M. stellatus in the low intertidal zone of wave-swept shores. {\textcopyright}

production drive secondary production in many ecosystems, often
sustaining diversity and overall productivity. Despite their
importance in structuring marine communities, there is little
understanding of how subsidies move through juxtaposed habitats
and into recipient communities. We investigated the transport of
detritus from kelp forests to a deep Arctic fjord (northern
Norway). We quantified the seasonal abundance and size structure
of kelp detritus in shallow subtidal (0-12 m), deep subtidal
(12-85 m), and deep fjord (400-450 m) habitats using a
combination of camera surveys, dive observations, and detritus
collections over 1 year. Detritus formed dense accumulations in
habitats adjacent to kelp forests, and the timing of depositions
coincided with the discrete loss of whole kelp blades during
spring. We tracked these blades through the deep subtidal and
into the deep fjord, and showed they act as a short-term
resource pulse transported over several weeks. In deep subtidal
regions, detritus consisted mostly of fragments and its depth
distribution was similar across seasons (50{\%} of total
observations). Tagged pieces of detritus moved slowly out of
kelp forests (displaced 4-50 m (mean 11.8 m ± 8.5 SD) in 11-17
days, based on minimum estimates from recovered pieces), and
most (75{\%}) variability in the rate of export was related to
wave exposure and substrate. Tight resource coupling between
kelp forests and deep fjords indicate that changes in kelp
abundance would propagate through to deep fjord ecosystems, with
likely consequences for the ecosystem functioning and services

abstract = {The ability of algae to change the shape of their thallus in response to the environment may be of functional and ecological importance to the alga, with many species of macroalgae exhibiting a great range of morphological variation across wave exposure gradients. However, differences in morphology detected between sheltered and exposed environments cannot determine whether such differences represent plastic responses to the local environment or whether morphology is genetically fixed. This study tested for differences in the morphology of the common kelp, Ecklonia radiata, between wave sheltered and exposed environments, and reciprocally transplanted juveniles to distinguish the nature of such differences (i.e. plastic vs fixed traits). Differences between exposure environments were consistent with known effects of exposure (i.e. a wide, thin thallus at sheltered sites and a narrow, thick thallus with a thick stipe at exposed sites). The reciprocal transplant experiment confirmed that morphological plasticity was the mechanism enabling this alga to display different patterns in morphology between exposure environments. Individuals transplanted to the exposed environment underwent a rapid and extreme response in morphology, which was not apparent in individuals transplanted to the sheltered environment that responded more slowly. These results suggest that stressors typical of sheltered environments (i.e. diffusion stress) may not be as influential (if at all) compared to stressors typical of exposed environments (i.e. breakage, dislodgement) in differentiating morphological characters between exposure environments.},
annote = {{\textgreater} Morphological variation enables species to occupy a broad range of physical environments and is commonly thought to enhance the survival and productivity of plants growing in physically different environments.

{\textgreater} Kelp morphology in relation to environmental gradients have been well documented.

{\textgreater} At sheltered sites macroalgal fronds tend to be wide, thin and undulate and at exposed sites are narrow, thick, flat and thick stipes. These morphological differences are thought to enable macroalgae to inhabit wave sheltered environments without compromising photosynthetic ability and growth and wave exposed environments by reducing breakage and/or dislodgement.

{\textgreater} Due to the range in scale of studies performed on this subject, no evidence has been presented whether the these responses to environmental gradients are plastic or fixed genetic responses based on ecotype which that particular population is adapted for.

{\textgreater} This study used a combination of observational and experimental analyses revealed that different mprhologies existed between exposed and sheltered sites.

{\textgreater} The differences in morphology is considered a plastic response to the local enviornment and did not reflect gentically fixed traits.

{\textgreater}The morphological responses exbited in this study was consistent with physiological and mechanical responses reported in other studies

{\textgreater} 11 out of 14 kelp morphology characters responded consistently to the differences in exposure. However 3 characters responded in an incosistent way (plant length, stipe length and lamina length).

{\textgreater} The results from the transplant experiment indicate a phenotypic response to the local environment. i.e transplanted individuals did not retain characters from their naitive site. Furthermore, transplanted individuals exbited characters consistent with naturally occuring individuals.

{\textgreater} Interestingly, individuals transplanted to wave exposed sites responded more rapidly compared to individuals transplanted to wave-sheltered sites. Furthermore, in wave exposed sites responses were sometimes over compensated for and maifested in the form of longer stipe lengths.

{\textgreater} In conclusion, variation in morphology of E. radiata exists across southern Australia which we now understand, at the scales of km,can be driven by the xternal environment. This study suggests that the environmentally specific forms of E. radiata in wave exposed and wave sheltered environments, at scales of 1-10km, are the result of a plastic response to the exposure conditions typical of the kelp native environment. Results also suggest that stressors typical of sheltered environments (i.e diffusion stress) may not be as influential compared to stressors typical of exposed environments (i.e. breakage/dislodgment) in differentiating morphological characters between exposure environments.},

water velocities of 10 to 20 m/s and accompanying accelerations

area and volume respectively, the bigger an individual is, the
larger the forces on it become. This size-force relationship
suggests that large intertidal algae must be particularly well
designed if they are to survive. The feather boa kelp, Egregiu
menziesii (Turner), grows to a size that is unusually large for
its wave-exposed habitat, leading us to inquire into the
mechanisms that allow it to attain this stature. A
hydro-mechanical computer model is used to predict the magnitude
of the forces on E. menziesii in various wave conditions and for
various plant sizes. Based on measurements of the strength of E.
menziesii, an intact, average-sized plant's survivorship in the
range of predicted wave forces is estimated to be nearly 100{\%}.
However, entanglement with other plants and damage from herbivory
can substantially lower an individual's chances of surviving a
severe storm. We speculate that E. menziesii `s straplike shape
may be an adaptation for accommodating the unpredictable

Direct observations of this key ecological and evolutionary process are, however, critically lacking. The importance of macroalgal rafting as a dispersal mechanism has remained uncertain, largely owing to lack of knowledge about the capacity of fauna to survive long voyages at sea and successfully make landfall and establish. Here, we directly document the rafting of a diverse assemblage of intertidal organisms across several hundred kilometres of open ocean, from the subantarctic to mainland New Zealand. Multispecies analyses using phylogeographic and ecological data indicate that 10 epifaunal invertebrate species rafted on six large bull kelp specimens for several weeks from the subantarctic Auckland and/or Snares Islands to the Otago coast of New Zealand, a minimum distance of some 400-600 km. These genetic data are the first to demonstrate that passive rafting can enable simultaneous trans-oceanic transport and landfall of numerous coastal taxa.},

abstract = {Wave action on exposed rocky coasts can be severe, generating
large hydrodynamic forces that have been proposed to constrain
the size of intertidal animals and plants. In contrast, flows
subtidally are more benign, and organisms, particularly
seaweeds, may grow quite large. The large dimensions of these
flexible macroalgae allow them to move during much or most of a
passing wave cycle, reducing relative water velocities and
modifying the forces the plants must endure. The consequences of
such wave-induced motion are explored for the stipitate
understory kelps Eisenia arborea and Pterygophora californica
using a numerical model that approximates these seaweeds as
vertically oriented cantilever beams subjected to lateral
hydrodynamic forces acting at their stipe tips. Bending moments
and peak stresses induced in the stipes of these species during
the passage of waves are calculated as functions of plant size
and shape and of water depth and sea state. Model predictions
for a subset of conditions are validated against real-time
measurements of bending moments acting on a Pterygophora
individual in the field. The results suggest that the allometric
patterns of growth exhibited by Eisenia and Pterygophora can
greatly reduce the stresses generated in the stipes of these
plants relative to isometric growth. Low stipe stiffness acts as
a general, particularly effective, stress-lowering mechanism.
The dynamic swaying associated with this low stiffness can also
modulate the magnitudes of peak stresses induced in the stipes
of these kelps. In particular, in shallow water under large
waves, dynamic loading can substantially increase induced
stress, suggesting that plant motion is an important factor
affecting the loading regime encountered by these organisms.},

this feature of wave-driven water motion is well recognized, the
mechanics of force imposition on compliant organisms is
incompletely understood. Here we undertake a field examination
of two processes that are thought to impose many of the more
dangerous forces that act on flexible benthic seaweeds:
impingement of breaking waves directly on emergent organisms,
and inertial effects tied to the rapid deceleration of mass that
occurs when a passively moving but attached organism abruptly
reaches the extent of its range of motion. We focus on two
common and important seaweed species: one intertidal kelp
(Egregia menziesii) and one subtidal kelp (Macrocystis
pyrifera). Results support the concept that wave impingement and
inertial effects produce intermittent force transients whose
magnitudes commonly exceed values readily attributable to drag.
Peak force transients are elevated by as much as a factor of 3
relative to drag in both small and large individuals, consistent
with smaller seaweeds being more susceptible to brief
impingement forces, and larger seaweeds being more vulnerable to
inertial forces. Because both wave impingement and inertial
effects vary with the size of an organism, they may have the
potential to influence the demographics of physical disturbance
in an array of flexible species.},

abstract = {Mechanisms of high-temperature tolerance in the kelp Laminaria
saccharina (L.) Lamour. were examined by comparing a
heat-tolerant ecotype from Long Island Sound (LIS), New York,
and a population from the Atlantic (ATL) coast of Maine. Greater
heat tolerance was not attributable to greater thermal stability
of the photosynthetic apparatus: LIS and ATL plants exhibited
similar short-term effects of high temperature on photosynthetic
capacity (P(max)) and quantum yield (estimated as the ratio of
variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence, F(v)/F(m)). As LIS
plants had consistently higher N and protein content than ATL
plants, the interaction between nitrogen nutrition and
high-temperature tolerance was examined. When grown under high N
supply and optimal temperature (12°C), LIS plants had a higher
density of photosystem II reaction centers (RCII), higher
activity of two Calvin cycle enzymes (ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase [RUBISCO] and NADP-dependent
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [G3PDH]), and higher
P(max) and F(v)/F(m) than ATL plants. Individual ATL plants,
furthermore, exhibited close correlations of RCII density and
enzyme activity with N and/or protein content. Variation in RCII
density and enzyme activity, in turn, largely accounted for
plant-to-plant differences in P(max) and F(v)/F(m).
Relationships among these parameters were generally weak or
lacking among individual LIS plants grown under optimal
conditions, apparently because luxury N consumption resulted in
excess reserves of photosynthetic apparatus components. Exposure
of N-replete LIS and ATL plants to a superoptimal temperature
(22°C) for 4 days caused an increase in the minimum turnover
time of the photosynthetic apparatus (tau) and a decrease in
P(max), but had no consistent effect on F(v)/F(m), RCII density,
PSU size (chlorophyll a/RCII), or enzyme activities. When plants
were subjected to concurrent N limitation and heat stress,
however, LIS and ATL populations exhibited quite different
responses. All photosynthetic parameters of N-limited ATL plants
declined sharply in response to high temperature, resulting in a
negative rate of daily net C fixation. In contrast, LIS plants
showed a reduction in PSU size, but maintained other parameters,
including daily C fixation, at levels similar to those of
N-limited plants at optimal temperature. Overall, the ability of
LIS plants to accumulate and maintain high N reserves appears to
be critical for heat tolerance and, therefore, for survival
during summer periods of simultaneous low N supply and
superoptimal temperature. ATL plants, which also experience low
summer N supply but not superoptimal temperatures, do not
accumulate large reserves of nitrogenous components and are
unable to tolerate the combined stress. Because low N supply
often co-occurs with high temperatures in temperate marine
systems, large-scale declines in algal productivity, such as
during El Nino events, are probably due to the interactive
effect of N limitation and heat stress.},

abstract = {Several large kelp species are capable of long-distance dispersal via rafting. However, seasonal changes in environmental conditions at the sea surface may variably affect the physiological status of the floating thalli; challenging conditions during summer may accelerate disintegration and cause rapid sinking. We used the bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica from northern-central Chile (30 S) to test seasonal variation in floating persistence. Experiments with tethered specimens were conducted in all seasons to assess how variable environmental conditions influence the morphology and photosynthetic characteristics of floating D. antarctica. Floating specimens stayed afloat at the surface for more than 1 month during moderate environmental conditions that prevailed in winter, spring, and fall. However, higher water temperatures and intense solar radiation in summer resulted in significant biomass losses and rapid disintegration of the floating kelps; consequently, they sank within {\textless}1 month. These strong seasonal effects were reflected in decreasing maximal quantum yield as well as in maximum relative electron transport rates of photosynthesis. Understanding physiological responses of floating algae is important because increasing global temperatures and shifts in solar radiation may strongly affect the survival of floating algae, potentially reducing the distances and frequencies of rafting dispersal. {\textcopyright} 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2013.},

abstract = {Seaweeds are ecologically important primary producers, competitors, and ecosystem engineers that play a central role in coastal habitats ranging from kelp forests to coral reefs. Although seaweeds are known to be vulnerable to physical and chemical changes in the marine environment, the impacts of ongoing and future anthropogenic climate change in seaweed-dominated ecosystems remain poorly understood. In this review, we describe the ways in which changes in the environment directly affect seaweeds in terms of their physiology, growth, reproduction, and survival. We consider the extent to which seaweed species may be able to respond to these changes via adaptation or migration. We also examine the extensive reshuffling of communities that is occurring as the ecological balance between competing species changes, and as top-down control by herbivores becomes stronger or weaker. Finally, we delve into some of the ecosystem-level responses to these changes, including changes in primary productivity, diversity, and resilience. Although there are several key areas in which ecological insight is lacking, we suggest that reasonable climate-related hypotheses can be developed and tested based on current information. By strategically prioritizing research in the areas of complex environmental variation, multiple stressor effects, evolutionary adaptation, and population, community, and ecosystem-level responses, we can rapidly build upon our current understanding of seaweed biology and climate change ecology to more effectively conserve and manage coastal ecosystems.},

@article{Hutchings2009-jb,
abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary
upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two
stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on
either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19–34°S),
which itself is subdivided at 26°S by the powerful Luderitz
upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the
boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history
cycle. While the ``Bakun triad'' of factors responsible for the
development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment,
concentration and retention) provide an important unifying
principle for understanding the compromise implicit in
adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been
neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The
role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of
shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is
being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so
strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to
distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of
several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the
1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the
north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a
subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling
system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle
upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate
productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated
from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The
northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system
with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and
moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted
state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during
the period 1970–1990, while hake have never fully recovered from
intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread
oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local
and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for
pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz–Orange River
Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong
winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute
a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source
water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone.
A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990
and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a
pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and
warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a
belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front.
Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely
affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery
ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank
and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west
coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the
Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an
upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal
stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic
upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A
large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer
season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic
levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal
upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an
important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution
and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy
populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5
years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment
of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history
patterns of these two species.},

by synoptic weather events. Spatial and temporal variabilities
in the wind fields, weather and SST are discussed on the basis
of the results of case studies made in summer. Low-level
equatorward winds were found to accelerate over the southern
portion of the Cape Peninsula, accompanying the eastward ridging
of the South Atlantic Anticyclone. Vertical profiles of wind and
time series of meteorological data from land stations close to
the sea are combined to describe the dynamics and mechanisms
governing the mesoscale patterns of wind and upwelling phenomena
around Olifantsbos, a locality on the south-west of the Cape
Peninsula. The observations may be compared with similar ones
made off Point Conception in California. The results highlight
the dominant influence of synoptic weather cycles at exposed

abstract = {At three sites (Papanui Inlet, Aquarium Point and Seacliff) on
the Otago coast of New Zealand and at one site (Point Loma) off
southern California, morphometric and short-term growth
measurements were made of single fronds of plants of Macrocystis
pyrifera (L.) C. Ag. near the time of the autumn equinox, in
1977. Near the apex, internodes and laminae were shorter in
wave-exposed Seacliff and California populations than in those of
Papanui Inlet and Aquarium Point in strong currents, although
lamina thick-ness was similar. In the immature region near the
apex, hnear relationships were apparent from double logarithmic
plots of stipe distance from apex vs node number, in-ternode
fresh weight vs length (different in the two areas), lamina width
vs length, fresh weight vs lamina area and immature lamina,
pneumatocyst and internode fresh weight vs node number.
Morphologically, Seacliff plants resembled those in California
more closely than those in the other New Zealand populations. The
relative growth rate in length of stipe internodes decreased
linearly with the logarithm of the distance from the apex, but
was less closely related to node number. Extrapolation gave zero
growth at 1.6 m at Aquarium Point and 2.9 m in Cali-fornia, where
the internode lengths coincided with a change in their
weight/length relationship. Slow relative growth proximal to
these points indicated a different type (mainly elongation). It
is suggested that the first, apical, type of growth, being
apparently unrelated to frond length, would be a useful measure
of activity over short time-periods. The relative growth rate in
lamina area (and prob-ably volume), while also related to
distance from the apex, showed a very different pattern,
increasing slightly to a peak at 100 to 200ram and declining to
nil by 1 m at Aquarium Point and 2 m in California. Maximal
lamina size was maintained for only 10 to 15 nodes at Aquarium
Point. Calculated node initiation frequencies were 2.7 d at
Papanui Inlet, 2 d at Aquarium Point, and 1 d in Cali-fornia. At
the latter sites it took about 2 mo for laminae and 2Y2 mo for
stipe internodes to mature. Deduced rela-tive growth rates in
stipe tissue and pneumatocyst fresh weight decreased from 0.24
(loge units per day) at the apex to 0.11 at 200 mm, where basal
lamina tissue had a rate of 0.29, a doubting in just over 2 d.
The production of tissue per frond was estimated as 25 and 36 g
fresh wt d -1 at Aquarium Point and in California, respectively.},

abstract = {The flow of detritus between habitats is an important form of connectivity that affects regional productivity and the spatial organization of marine ecosystems. Kelps form highly productive beds or forests that produce detritus through incremental blade erosion, fragmentation of blades, and dislodgement of whole fronds and thalli. Rates of detrital production range from 8 to 2657 g C m−2 yr−1 for blade erosion and fragmentation, and from 22 to 839 g C m−2 yr−1 for loss of fronds and thalli. The estimated global average rate of detrital production by kelps is 706 g C m−2 yr−1, accounting for 82{\%} of annual kelp productivity. Detrital production rates are regulated by current and wave-driven hydrodynamic forces and are highest during severe storms and follow- ing blade weakening through damage by grazers and encrusting epibionts. Detritus settles within kelp beds or forests and is exported to neighboring or distant habitats, including sandy beaches, rocky intertidal shores, rocky and sedimentary subtidal areas, and the deep sea. Exported kelp detritus can provide a significant resource subsidy and enhance secondary production in these communities ranging from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers from the source of production. Loss of kelp biomass is occurring worldwide through the combined effects of climate change, pol- lution, fishing, and harvesting of kelp, which can depress rates of detrital production and subsidy to adjacent communities, with large-scale consequences for productivity.},

abstract = {The subtidal understorey seaweed communities were studied along a coastal distance of 104km around the Cape Peninsula, which is situated in an overlap region between two marine provinces and characterized by a considerable temperature gradient. Sampling was carried out at six sites (4 to 10 quadrats per site) around the Cape Peninsula. For each of the quadrats, biomass of each species, grazing, and environmental variables such as temperature, wave exposure and sand cover were determined. The data were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and two way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). A total of 142 seaweed taxa were found at the six sites (21 Chlorophyta, 14 Phaeophyta and 107 Rhodophyta). The two sides of the Peninsula have a very different biomass-composition of Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta. The biomass of Rhodophyta in the Atlantic sites is much higher than in the Bay, and the biomass of Chlorophyta is higher in False Bay than on the west coast. A change in tloristic composition of subtidal algal communities around the Cape Peninsula can be observed and is principally related to seawater temperature and wave exposure. Next to these physical factors, grazing is demonstrated to be important in determining species composition. A lower degree of wave exposure might result in a higher number of grazers in False Bay. The occurrence of a higher cover of encrusting corallines in the Bay is probably a consequence of the higher grazing pressure. Distinct community types can be recognized from TWINSPAN and CCA.

abstract = {In order to understand variability in recruitment to populations
of benthic and demersal marine species, it is critical to
distinguish between the contributions due to variations in larval
settlement versus those caused by post-settlement mortality. In
this study, fine-scale (1-2 days) temporal changes in recruit
abundance were followed through an entire settlement season in a
temperate demersal fish in order to determine 1) how dynamic the
process of recruitment is on a daily scale, 2) whether settlement
and post-settlement mortality are influenced by habitat structure
and conspecific density, and 3) how the relationship between
settlement and recruitment changes over time. ''Settlement'' is
considered to be the arrival of new individuals from the pelagic
habitat, and ''recruitment'' is defined as the number of
individuals surviving arbitrary periods of time after settlement.
Replicate standardized habitat units were placed in 2 spatial
configurations (clumped and randomly dispersed) and monitored
visually for cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) settlement and
recruitment every 1-2 days throughout the settlement season. The
process of recruitment in T. adspersus was highly variable at a
fine temporal scale. Changes in the numbers of recruits present
on habitat units were due to both settlement of new individuals
and mortality of animals previously recruited. The relative
importance of these two processes appeared to change from day to
day. The magnitude of the change in recruit number did not differ
between the clumped and random habitats. However, post-settlement
loss was significantly greater on randomly dispersed than clumped
habitats. During several sampling dates, the extent of the change
in recruit abundance was correlated with the density of resident
con-specifics; however, on other dates no such relationship
appeared to exist. Despite the presence of significant
relationships between the change in recruit number and density,
there was no evidence of either density-dependent mortality or
settlement. Initially, there was a strong relationship between
settlement and recruitment; however, this relationship weakened
over time. Within 2 months after the cessation of settlement,
post-settlement loss was greater than 99{\%}, and no correlation
remained between recruitment and the initial pattern of
settlement. The results of this study demonstrate that the
spatial arrangement of the habitat affects the rate and intensity
of post-settlement loss. Counter to much current thinking, this
study suggests that in order to understand the population ecology
of reef fishes, knowledge of what habitats new recruits use and
how mortality varies with structural aspects of the habitats is
essential.},

thermal optima for performance. Optimum temperatures in warmer
regions were more than 1°C higher than in cooler regions.
Biogeographically, the thermal optima for gametophytes were more
strongly linked to long-term temperature characteristics of a
region (annual extremes, 3 yr range) than short-term variation
(mean for the month prior) in sea temper- ature. These results
document that present-day populations of E. radiata have adjusted
their gametophyte thermal sensitivity according to their local
environment, and further indicate that these differences are
adaptive rather than phenotypic. Collectively, these findings
suggest that the scope for thermal adaptation and gametophyte
performance of E. radiata across most of its Australian

abstract = {The American lobster Homarus americanus and kelp Laminaria
longicruris and L. saccharina are prominent and often intimately
associated members of the subtidal community in the western North
Atlantic Ocean. However, no one has identified the nature of this
relationship or specifically investigated whether kelp beds are a
superior habitat for lobsters. We conducted field studies in 1990
and 1991 at a coastal site centrally located along the Gulf of
Maine, USA, to determine how lobsters use kelp beds as habitat.
Identically sized and spaced plots of live and artificial
(plastic) kelp were established and monitored for lobster
population densities. Adjacent featureless sediment plots of
identical size served as controls. Lobster population density and
biomass were significantly higher in both real and artificial
kelp treatments than in non-kelp control plots (p {\textless} 0.0001). The
change in lobster density was apparent the day following
placement of the experiment, so a secondary trophic effect such
as attracting prey into treatments is unlikely to have occurred.
Thus, kelp beds can affect local lobster population densities by
providing shelter for lobsters, thereby concentrating individuals
and increasing the local carrying capacity of potential lobster
habitats. The effect of kelp beds on the local carrying capacity
of lobster habitats was further explored by testing how lobsters
respond to differing patch sizes. A graded size series of
circular patches of artificial kelp was established, in which
kelp blade density and total area were held constant for each
treatment. Treatments were subdivided into four 1 M2, two 2 M2,
or one 4 m2 patches. Experiments were surveyed for lobster
population density and size structure to determine ff statistical
differences existed among treatments. Lobster density was
significantly greater in the smallest patches (p {\textless} 0.001).
Moreover, lobsters typically occupied the edges of kelp beds, and
their abundance within kelp patches corresponded to the patch's
perimeter-to-area relationship. This suggests that edge effects'
influence the local carrying capacity for lobsters by influencing
the lobsters' choice of kelp beds as habitat.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in the NE Atlantic are highly related to physical factors and to temporal changes in temperature. On a large scale, we identified borders for kelp recovery and sea urchin persistence along the north-south gradient. Sea urchin persistence was also related to the coast-ocean gradient. The southern border corresponds to summer temperatures exceeding about 10°C, a threshold value known to be critical for sea urchin recruitment and development. The outer border along the coast-ocean gradient is related to temperature, wave exposure and salinity. On a finer scale, kelp recovery occurs mainly at ridges in outer, wave exposed, saline and warm areas whereas sea urchins still dominate in inner, shallow and cold areas, particularly in areas with optimal current speed for sea urchin foraging. In contrast to other studies in Europe, we here show a positive influence of climate change to presence of a long-lived climax canopy-forming kelp. The extent of the coast-ocean gradient varies within the study area, and is especially wide in the southern part where the presence of islands and skerries increases the area of the shallow coastal zone. This creates a large area with intermediate physical conditions for the two species and a mosaic of kelp and sea urchin dominated patches. The statistical models (GAM and BRT) show high performance and indicate recovery of kelp in 45-60{\%} of the study area. The study shows the value of combining a traditional (GAM) and a more complex (BRT) modeling approach to gain insight into complex spatial patterns of species or habitats. The results, methods and approaches are of general ecological relevance regardless of ecosystems and species, although they are particularly relevant for understanding and exploring the corresponding changes between algae and grazers in different coastal areas.},

abstract = {Laminaria pallida and Ecklonia maxima are large, commercially
valuable kelps that co-dominate inshore waters of the west coast
of Southern Africa in a geographically changing pattern. In the
south, E. maxima dominates and forms a canopy in shallow waters
({\textless} about 5 m deep), with L. pallida forming a sub-canopy and
extending down to 20 m or more. Northward along the Southern
African coast and into Namibia, E. maxima is progressively
replaced by L. pallida. Corresponding with this change in
dominance, L. pallida shows certain morphological changes along
the south-to-north geographical gradient. To explain these
phenomena, we examined a range of morphological characters in
both kelps (stipe length, stipe weight, stipe outer diameter,
stipe inner diameter, length of hollow section in the stipe, and
frond weight), and various environmental factors (seawater
temperature, seawater turbidity, cloud/fog data, daylength, and
wave and wind data). Our results, based on measurements at seven
sites along 1600 km of coast between Cape Town and Swakopmund
(Namibia), quantified and confirmed the change in dominance and
the northward increase in stipe hollowness in L. pallida. The
morphology of E. maxima did not change with latitude. Water
turbidity, wind speed, and wave height differed significantly
along the coast. However, only turbidity showed a steady trend,
increasing northward in terms of all indicators (chlorophyll a,
particulate inorganic carbon, particulate organic carbon) while
wind speed and wave height showed a generally decreasing trend.
Furthermore, the hollowness of L. pallida was also not related to
the flexibility of the stipes. Our results suggest that L.
pallida sporophytes may progressively outcompete E. maxima
northward, perhaps because they are more low-light tolerant, and
we suggest that by developing a hollow stipe, the sporophytes may
grow faster in length, potentially increasing their competitive
advantage in the shallow water where they must compete with
sporophytes of E. maxima.},

depth in Tei, Tosa Bay (southern Japan; water temperature
15?29°C) from 1995 to 1996, and in Nabeta Bay, Shimoda (central
Japan; water temperature 13?25°C) from 1996 to 1997. Growth
rings were checked for all samples and mean values of each
biometric parameter of sporophytes 1-year-old and over were
compared. The plant length (stipe length + primary blade length)
was always shorter in Tei sporophytes (24?52 cm) than Nabeta
sporophytes (70?100 cm), the difference being mainly owing to
the shorter stipe length in Tei sporophytes (7?14 cm) than in
Nabeta sporophytes (54?83 cm). However, the primary blade length
was sometimes longer in Tei sporophytes (12?38 cm) than in
Nabeta sporophytes (14?21 cm). Stipe diameter, longest bladelet
length and primary blade width were mostly less in Tei
sporophytes (8.6?12.4 mm, 5.5?7.0 cm and 23.4?38.0 cm,
respectively) than Nabeta sporophytes (16.4?20.2 mm, 9.2?12.0 cm
and 43.0?52.6 cm, respectively). Nevertheless, the number of
bladelets of sporophytes from Tei (15?28) and Nabeta (18?29)
were within the same range. At Tei, 32?43{\%} of the sporophytes
had wrinkled blades in summer and autumn, whereas wrinkled
primary blades or bladelets were not observed in Nabeta
sporophytes throughout the experimental period. These
morphometric differences of E. cava between the two localities
are suggested to be dependent on environmental factors,

Kelp forests exhibit high rates of primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, support high levels of biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. Compared with many other regions, kelp forests around the UK have been largely understudied despite their recognised importance and the possible impacts of environmental change factors. We conducted surveys at 12 kelp-dominated open-coast sites within four regions in the UK, spanning {\~{}}??9?? in latitude and {\~{}}??3????C in mean sea temperature. We used a combination of quadrat-scale abundance and percent cover data as well as transect-scale canopy cover estimates to quantify ecological structure at multiple spatial scales. Kelp forest structure varied significantly between sites (nested within region) and also between regions. Regional-scale differences were principally driven by a higher abundance/cover of Alaria esculenta at the colder northern regions (i.e. north and west Scotland), and the presence of the Lusitanian kelp Laminaria ochroleuca at some sites in the southernmost region (i.e. southwest England) but nowhere else. The kelp Laminaria hyperborea dominated all sites and varied significantly between sites but not regions. All assemblage-level and population-level response variables were highly variable between sites within regions, suggesting that environmental factors varying at corresponding spatial scales (e.g. wave exposure, turbidity, sedimentation) are important drivers of pattern. The detection of regional-scale variability suggests that predicted changes in ocean climate, particularly increased sea temperature, may lead to changes in kelp forest structure in the future, with poleward range contractions (for A. esculenta) and expansions (for L. ochroleuca) likely. However, as the distribution-abundance patterns of the assemblage dominant L. hyperborea did not vary predictably with ocean temperature at this spatial scale, the fundamental structure of these habitats may be more influenced by localised factors, at least in the short-term. The relative importance of multiple, concurrent environmental change factors in structuring UK kelp forests remains largely unknown.},

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6 degrees C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

abstract = {Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of cold- water rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodi- versity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40–60° latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2–3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the wide- spread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish-to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin popu- lations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large- scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.},

The density of the kelp canopy varied greatly during the 13 mo study, ranging from 0.03 to 8.03 m2 blade tissue m–2 sea surface. Time series analysis of flow velocity, light, temperature and seawater nitrate concentrations inside and out- side of the bed indicated that when canopy density was high (May to September) current speeds in the bed were 25{\%} of incident flow, and light below the canopy (at 1 m depth) was reduced to 10{\%} surface irradiance. Nitrate concentrations were highly variable and similar between inside and out- side moorings. When the canopy was well developed, kelp fronds on the seaward edge of the bed had faster elongation rates and larger blades, resulting in higher overall growth rates (mass added per day) than interior fronds. Carbon and nitrogen accumulation by edge fronds was also higher dur- ing this period, which fueled growth rates of edge fronds that were nearly twice as high as interior fronds when the canopy was densest. Thus, the growth and tissue chemistry of M. pyrifera within the kelp bed depended on the extent to which the bed modified ambient physical conditions.},

abstract = {Rafting of marine and terrestrial organisms has been reported from a variety of substrata and from all major oceans of the world. Herein we present information on common rafting organisms and on ecological interactions during rafting voyages. An extensive literature review revealed a total of 1205 species, for which rafting was confirmed or inferred based on distributional or genetic evidence. Rafting organisms comprised cyanobacteria, algae, protists, invertebrates from most marine but also terrestrial phyla, and even a few terrestrial vertebrates. Marine hydrozoans, bryozoans, crustaceans and gastropods were the most common taxa that had been observed rafting. All major feeding types were represented among rafters, being dominated by grazing/boring and suspension-feeding organisms, which occurred on all floating substrata. Besides these principal trophic groups, predators/scavengers and detritus feeders were also reported. Motility of rafting organisms was highest on macroalgae and lowest on abiotic substrata such as plastics and volcanic pumice. Important trends were revealed for the reproductive biology of rafting organisms. A high proportion of clonal organisms (Cnidaria and Bryozoa) featured asexual reproduction, often in combination with sexual reproduction. Almost all rafting organisms have internal fertilisation, which may be due to the fact that gamete concentrations in the rafting environment are too low for successful fertilisation of external fertilisers. Following fertilisation, many rafting organisms incu- bate their offspring in/on their body or deposit embryos in egg masses on rafts. Local recruitment, where offspring settle in the immediate vicinity of parents, is considered an important advantage for establishing persistent local populations on a raft, or in new habitats. Some organisms are obligate rafters, spending their entire life cycle on a raft, but the large majority of reported rafters are considered facultative rafters. These organisms typically live in benthic (or terrestrial) habitats, but may become dispersed while being confined to a floating item. Substratum characteristics (complexity, surface, size) have important effects on the composition of the rafting community. While at sea, ecological interactions (facilitation, competition, predation) contribute to the com- munity succession on rafts. Organisms capable to compete for and exploit resources on a raft (space and food) will be able to persist throughout community succession. The duration of rafting voyages is closely related to rafting distances, which may cover various geographical scales. In chronological order, three features of an organism gain in importance during rafting, these being ability to (1) hold onto floating items, (2) establish and compete successfully and (3) develop persistent local 279 MARTIN THIEL {\&} LARS GUTOW populations during a long voyage. Small organisms that do not feed on their floating substratum and, with asexual reproduction or direct development, combine all these features appear to be most suited for long-distance dispersal on rafts and successful colonisation after reaching new habitats. All available evidence suggests that rafting is an important process for the population dynamics of many organisms and that it also has had and continues to have a strong influence on coastal biodiversity.},

abstract = {Understanding temporal variation at the scale of weeks to months is critical to understanding broad temporal patterns in diversity in the same way as understanding diversity across landscapes relies on understanding variation at the scale of meters. However, whereas small-scale spatial variation in temperate reef algal assemblages has been extensively studied, fine-scale temporal changes have not been well addressed. By sampling the macroalgae of a subtidal reef near Perth (Australia), dominated by the small kelp Ecklonia radiata, every 40 days over a 2-year period, we were able to test whether temporal changes in species richness, assemblage structure and species turn-over were related to seasonal changes in surface temperature, solar radiation and wave height. A total of 93 macroalgal taxa were identified, and species richness per sampling time ranged from 25 to 64 taxa 1.25 m-2. Biomass of E. radiata was positively correlated with changes in sea surface temperature and light, and negatively correlated with wave height. Species richness, assemblage structure and turn-over of other macroalgae were more associated with seasonal changes in kelp biomass than environmental variables per se. We conclude that seasonal changes in environmental conditions drive changes in the kelp canopy, which in turn drive changes in species richness and assemblage structure. This suggests that habitat-formers such as kelps can exert a strong temporal influence on associated communities, analogous to well-described spatial influences. Thus, as kelp canopy biomass expands and retracts over time-scales of weeks to months, so does available space for colonization and growth, resulting in a high species turn-over. Species richness is therefore increased and maintained through time, in the same way as canopy-gap mosaics increase and maintain species richness across spatial landscapes. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

annote = {Maintenance of high diversity of macroalgae in many temperate rocky reef communities relies on biotic and abiotic factors and processes that vary spatially and temporally. In multi-layered assemblages dominated by canopy algae, spatial variation in diversity varies on the order of meters to tens of meters, and these patterns are commonly attributed to interactions between canopy layers and wave disturbance.

Canopy layers influence recruitment, survival and physiological of other algal species, through direct or indirect modification of the local environment. Wave removal causes canopy removal, and therefore maintains a mosaic of gaps and canopy-dominated patches.
Species richness and diveristy of algae is usually lower under canopies, than in gaps.

Temporal changes in subtidal algal assemblages have been associated with seasonal patterns in light, temperature, water motion, and nutrient enrichment via upwelling and ocean circulation patterns (Breda and Foster, 1985; Nu´nez-Lo´pez and Casas Valdez, 1998; Diaz-Pullido and Garzon-Ferreira, 2002).

Temporal dynamics in algal species richness, assemblage structure and species turnover at Marmion was a function of a complex interplay between environmental change and the in-
fluence of the dominant kelp, Ecklonia radiata. Kelp biomass was directly correlated with environmental variation, whereas species richness of algae was associated with temporal changes in kelp biomass. Seasonal change in biomass of E. radiata, was correlated with all of the environmental data, particularly temperature.

The seasonal increase in kelp canopy biomass may be attributed to longer days and increased light levels. The negative correlation of wave height on canopy biomass suggests a thinning of kelp canopy mechanism (Thomsen et al 2004)
We conclude that, over the course of a year, there was large variation in kelp biomass as well as species richness and assemblage structure of reef macroalgae. Seasonal changes in envi-
ronmental conditions drove changes in the kelp canopy, which in turn influenced changes in species richness and assem-
blage structure. Habitat-forming species such as kelps can exert a strong temporal influence on associated communities, which in many ways resembles well-described spatial influences. Thus, as kelp canopy biomass expands and retracts over
time-scales of weeks to months, so does available space for colonization and growth, resulting in a high species turn-over. High species richness is therefore maintained over time, in the
same way as canopy-gap mosaic increase and maintain species richness across spatial landscapes.},

abstract = {This study examined the consistency of the effect of wave exposure on the morphology of Ecklonia radiata, a small kelp, across a broad geographic range ({\textgreater}1100 km). Fifteen morphological characters were measured on individuals from sites of low (2.5 ± 0.8 S.E.) and high (12.2 ± 2.0 S.E.) wave exposure (Baardseth's index) within six locations in southwestern Australia. With the exception of lateral width (P = 0.0001), none of the morphological characters were consistently statistically different (P {\textgreater} 0.06) between high and low wave exposure and correlations with wave exposure were generally weak (r {\textless} 0.60). While 12 of the 15 characters were statistically different (P {\textless} 0.008) between sites of different exposure within at least one location, the direction of difference (significant or not) was opposite between some locations for all but one character (lateral width). ANOSIM was not able to separate thalli from high and low exposure when all locations were pooled (Clarke's R = 0.127), but within each location most sites showed better separation (0.126 {\textless} Clarke's R {\textless} 0.829). Despite the lack of statistical differences, trends suggested that E. radiata responds to exposure by having drag-reducing (small size, narrow laterals and blades, low spinosity) and strength-increasing (relatively large holdfast, thick stipe and thick blades and lamina) morphological traits, as observed for several other kelps in small-scale studies. We conclude that while wave exposure does have an effect on kelp morphology, the effect is not independent of other location-specific processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This article illustrates from a data set that even if the uncertainties in current, wind and waves are reduced the forecast using a dynamic iceberg models stays difficult, because of the sensitivity of the model to different parameters and inputs. Nevertheless, if the uncertainty of the current driving force on the iceberg is reduced by measuring the current at the iceberg location, it is possible under specific conditions to estimate the approximate iceberg shape. This iceberg shape geometry can be used directly in the dynamic iceberg model.},

abstract = {Long-distance dispersal is one of the main drivers structuring the distribution of marine biodiversity. This study reports the first occurrence of Macrocystis pyrifera and Durvillaea antarctica rafts on the southwestern warm temperate coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Our results indicate that an extreme meteo-oceanographic event, characterized by a northward, displacement of cold sub-Antarctic oceanic waters driven by an extratropical cyclone, could account for these unusual occurrences. A niche model based on known current distribution and maximum entropy principle (MAXENT), revealed the availability of suitable habitats at lower latitudes, outside their actual distribution edges. The distributional boundaries, mainly driven by temperature and irradiance, suggest the existence of environmental suitability in warm temperate areas, as well as in the Northern Hemisphere off Atlantic and Asian coasts. These theoretical edges and respective environmental drivers agree with the physiological affinities of both species, supporting the hypothesis that these variables act as limiting factors for their occurrences in tropical or warmer areas. Emerging regions can function as refuges and stepping-stones, providing substrate with adequate habitat conditions for recruitment of propagules, allowing eventual colonization. Long dispersal events reinforce the need for an extensive discussion on selective management of natural dispersion, biological invasions, refuge mapping and conservation initiatives in a transnational perspective.},
annote = {Discussion

"involving passive dispersion of these species recorded distances of tens of kilometers [46,96]. Our data Diversity 2018, 10, 11 10 of 25 indicate that M. pyrifera and D. antarctica potentially traveled a distance of at least 2700 km, reaching the Brazilian coast, still alive."

"Storms and strong-wind events, such as extratropical cyclones, can detach canopy-forming kelps, transporting the rafts and immigrants, facilitating long-distance dispersal and transport of their propagules to suitable niches [25]. Furthermore, these storm and strong wind conditions can provide a pick-up/drop off process, and enhance the along-shelf current towards lower latitudes. This period of ideal conditions, with low temperatures and an enhanced northward current is observed at the end of Winter and late Spring in this region [98,99]."

"Considering the floating and rafting nature of these species, they probably reached the coast
of Brazil driven by strong extratropical cyclone winds, and changes in the velocity and SST on the surface coastal currents [64]. Moreover, the plume of the La Plata River (35◦58? S; 55◦18? W) along with the south-northward coastal circulation, may have contributed to the dispersal of the individuals of D. antarctica and M. pyrifera to the coastal region of southwestern Brazil. Nutrient enrichment from rivers and upwelling feed the high demand of kelp species for nitrogen and phosphate [93], helping in the resilience of rafts during the long drift."

However, populations of M. pyrifera may be limited not only by physical factors such as
temperature, light and nutrients, but also by the type of substrate and the presence of herbivores (e.g., sea urchin species such as Loxechinus albus) [36]. Due to a lack of available herbivore data, on a global scale, among other important biological interactions, these biotic factors were not considered in our evaluations.

Conclusions

"The occurrence of these kelp rafts in the Brazilian and Uruguayan coast does not characterize the expansion of their limits of occurrence because settled populations were not found. However, such events could be regarded as an indication of change in climatic/oceanographic processes. Our results indicate that viable rafts can travel long distances, which demand a further discussion about long-term management of these immigration events. Therefore, changes in current temperatures and patterns may alter kelps raft routes and potential colonization areas. Considering the remarkable role that these rafts play in facilitating the dispersal and connectivity between coastal faunal and floristic communities, events such as this require greater attention regarding invasive species monitoring programs, niche conservation policies and climatic changes.

abstract = {The shallow subtidal rocky habitats in most temperate coastal areas are con- spicuously dominated by large brown algae in the orders Laminariales and Fucales. These algae are commonly referred to as kelps, although the term technically refers to Laminariales only. Their high productivity and com- plicated biological structure make kelps especially important members of their communities. For this reason, these communities havc received a great deal of research, including one of the first scientific applications of diving (128). This review summarizes the status of research programs operating within very different scales and emphasizes the point that a real understanding of the processes under study must come from the proper perspective and integration of the other levels. A taxonomic account of the world's kelps is far too complex for the scope of this review, but Mann (146) has characterized the world's kelp forests by their dominant genera. Laminaria species are found in many parts of the world but dominate both sides of the Atlantic and the coasts of China and Japan. Ecklonia dominates some kelp forests in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and a few other southern hemisphere localities. The giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forms dense tbrests in many parts of the world including areas of the northeast Pacific, the southern shores of South America, many Southern Ocean islands, and isolated areas of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Macrocystis pyriJora does not occur in the eastern Pacific area north of San Francisco, California; however, this northern region has the highest species diversity of kelps in the world (63), with Macrocystis integrifolia and Nereocystis, Alaria, Pterygophora, and Laminaria, among other conspicuous genera. *The US Government has the right to retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license in and to any copyright covering this paper. 215 Annual Reviews www.annualreviews.org/aronline 216 DAYTON Annu.

The life cycle of all kelps consists of an alternation of generations between microscopic haploid gametophytes and large diploid sporophytes which pro- dhce reproductive sori, often on specialized sporophylls. Reduction division occurs in the sporangium, producing microscopic zoospores which are released to settle on the bottom and develop into male and female gametophytes. Gametophytes produce antheridia and oogonia; fertilization results in zygote formation and the growth of sporophytes. Most ecological studies have focused on the large sporophyte stage; however, recent work emphasizes the different threshold factors important to the separate life-history stages, especially the gametophytes and juvenile stages (50, 205). This review is possible because the huge and often rather diffuse literature has received excellent reviews (21, 80, 119, 146, 158, 183, 205). ! will emphasize the kelp community models being developed in the northeastern Pacific because of my own familiarity with the system.

Direct observations of this key ecological and evolutionary process are, however, critically lacking. The importance of macroalgal rafting as a dispersal mechanism has remained uncertain, largely owing to lack of knowledge about the capacity of fauna to survive long voyages at sea and successfully make landfall and establish. Here, we directly document the rafting of a diverse assemblage of intertidal organisms across several hundred kilometres of open ocean, from the subantarctic to mainland New Zealand. Multispecies analyses using phylogeographic and ecological data indicate that 10 epifaunal invertebrate species rafted on six large bull kelp specimens for several weeks from the subantarctic Auckland and/or Snares Islands to the Otago coast of New Zealand, a minimum distance of some 400-600 km. These genetic data are the first to demonstrate that passive rafting can enable simultaneous trans-oceanic transport and landfall of numerous coastal taxa.},

abstract = {Floating seaweeds serve as dispersal agents for various organisms, but their survival at the sea surface may be compromised by physiological stress and epibiont overgrowth. Most previous experiments have been conducted in laboratory mesocosms where epibiont colonization is limited, but in their natural environment floating seaweeds are frequently overgrown by epibionts, which might negatively affect seaweeds or even cause their sinking. To test this hypothesis, we conducted field experiments in northern-central Chile (30{\{}$\backslash$textbackslashtextdegree{\}}S) with floating giant kelps Macrocystis pyrifera to determine the time until sinking, epibiotic bryozoan load, and their physiological status across different seasons. Floating sporophytes persisted for at least 4 weeks at the sea surface and sank in all seasons after bryozoan loads exceeded 40 {\{}{\%}{\}} of the raft biomass. At the time of sinking, the kelp rafts were physiologically viable and biomass losses were relatively minor. In autumn, kelp rafts stayed afloat for an average of 41 days (maximum: 52 days) during moderate environmental conditions (cool water temperature and moderate solar radiation) and slow growth of epibionts. However, higher water temperatures in summer seemed to enhance the growth of epibiotic bryozoans but not the growth of M. pyrifera, causing earlier sinking. The results indicate that the high growth rates of encrusting bryozoans provoke sinking of the kelp rafts, representing the first demonstrated case of epibiont-induced sinking of otherwise healthy floating seaweeds.

annote = {Introduction

Seasonal variations in the abundance of floating seaweed rafts has attributed to differential supply from benthic sources or to variable peristsance times of seaweed rafts.

Persistance of seaweed rafts affected by herbivory, epibiont load, solar radiation and water temperature.

Grazing removes tissue material which comprimises growth and photosynthesis.
Epibiont load can have positive benfits (provide carbon dioxide through respiration and nitrogen through excretion of ammonium) and negative effects (enhance frond breakage and suppression of photosynthetic material). In general it is assumed epibiont load and grazing pressure increase over time.

Understanding of raft longegivity has been investigated through mesocosm experiments which has reduced abundance of are low or absent. Also does not accuratley represent natural rafting conditions.

AIm was to "In order to determine the seasonal variation in floating persistence and the factors contributing to the demise of floating M. pyrifera, we conducted field experiments during different seasons."

Materials and methods Seasonal

Conducted through tethering experiments and kelp for experiment collected over seasons. Sensors used for environmental conditions. Physiological parameters of kelp determined using chlorophyll a fluorescence of photosynthetic system II (PSII). In vivo measurements performed using PAM.
Floating persistence was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier sur- vival analysis. The different Kaplan–Meier survival curves were compared with the Peto-Wilcoxon
test. Logistic curves were fitted to the floating (0) or sinking (1) prob- ability of sporophytes depending on bryozoan biomass.

Discussion

Floating Macrocystis sporophytes stayed afloat for more than 1 month during moderate environmental conditions (cool water temperature and moderate solar radiation) and slow growth of epibionts in autumn. Higher water temperatures in summer seemed to enhance the growth of epibionts, but not the growth of M. pyrifera, which resulted in earlier sinking compared to autumn. Growth and photophysiological param- eters of Macrocystis showed only minor seasonal variation, confirming the high acclimation potential of giant kelp to raft- ing conditions. The results of this study document for the first time that kelps remained physiologically active and viable until the day of sinking, but that the large load of the rapidly growing bryozoan epibionts caused sinking of the kelp rafts.

kelps rafts persisted for 10-53 days depending on season, with an average for 41 days in autumn, 25-29 days in other seasons. Time until maximum (100{\%}) cover of bryozoans was dependent on season. warmer temperatures increased growth rate of bryozoans and slowed down in cooler temperatures. Bryozaons may also provide protection from solar radiation but overall effect is reduced photosynthetic performance and sinking. Warmer temperatures reduced physiological performance.

Conclusions

"Raft persistence strongly depends on favorable seawater conditions which makes these macrophyte rafts highly susceptible to global climate change (MacReadie et al. 2011). Our study docu- mented for the first time a case of epibiont-induced sinking of otherwise healthy floating seaweeds. Increasing tempera- tures in the global oceans may enhance epibiont growth and thereby suppress the dispersal potential of floating sea- weeds, even of species well known to rapidly acclimate to stressful conditions at the sea surface."},

abstract = {The probability of successful dispersal by sessile benthic invertebrates is thought to strongly influence their geographic distribution and population genetics. Generally, species with long-lived planktonic larvae are expected to exhibit wider distribution patterns than those species which brood their young, due to their presumably greater potential for dispersal. In some cases, however, brooding species exhibit broad distributions and show evidence of genetic exchange with geographically distant populations. One potential factor that has been invoked as an explanation is dispersal by floating and rafting of adults and egg masses. Several studies have shown that it is possible for sessile adults to disperse on the order of several to many thousand kilometers by rafting on debris in ocean currents. With very few exceptions, however, direct evidence of rafting in the open ocean has been lacking. We present evidence of long-distance (1300 to 2000 km) dispersal of a brooding pelecypod, Gaimardia trapesina (Lamarck, 1819), in the Southern Ocean in the vicinity of Cape Horn, the Falkland Islands, and the antarctic island South Georgia (54{\~{}} 37 {\~{}} W). Data on survival and fecundity rates of G. trapesina and the prevalence of kelp rafts collected during the austral winter of 1993 indicate that dispersal by rafting can occur over ecologically relevant time scales and could potentially serve as a significant means of genetic exchange between populations.},

These rafts provide habitat for a variety of coastal and pelagic fauna. The distances dispersed and the period available for species to utilize these habitats, however, depend on the longevity of the raft and methods for determining the age of rafts are unknown. A method to age drifting M. pyrifera rafts based on a change in length of blades (BL) following detachment is validated here. This technique determines the period of time since detachment and not the actual age of the plant. In general, average BL decreases from initial attached values of 50-60 to about 0 cm, when rafts sink. The rate of aging, or deterioration of BL, is related to water temperature, and sets the period a raft stays afloat. Maximal estimates of ages of rafts were between 63 and 109 days, depending on the exact method used. Their lifetime will limit the distances dispersed by kelp rafts in Southern California, and this methodology will be useful for determining the temporal patterns of abundance of fauna associated with rafts.

Polysiphonia Greville and Hypnea J.V. Lamouroux species were the most common taxa on this list, and the Mediterranean Sea and the NE Atlantic bioregions have received most of the 346 taxa. The most important vectors that carry non-native seaweeds are hull fouling and the transport of aquaculture products including ‘blind passengers'. Once a seaweed has arrived in a new location, it can establish a permanent population and spread through natural dispersal or human activity. Non-native seaweeds have negative impacts on native species through competition, habitat destruction and keystone competition, but also positive impacts through habitat formation, food provision and cascading habitat formation. Quantitative meta-analyses have shown that invasive seaweeds typically have a negative effect on local plants, but neutral or positive effects on animal communities. New meta-analyses presented here indicate that impacts increase with the abundance of non-native seaweeds and that non-native seaweeds may increase sample similarity in invaded plant communities, but not in animal communities. The literature on the impact of non-native seaweeds is extensive, but most studies have focused on a few high-profile species. Comprehensive analyses should be done for more species to allow for better predictions. We conclude that non-native seaweeds have altered shallow coastal communities in most biogeographical regions, and impacts will likely increase along with increases in human populations, transport and associated stressors.},

However, not much is known about levels of population genetic connectivity maintained by rafting over transoceanic distances. We assess the evolutionary impact of kelp-rafting by estimating population genetic differentiation in three kelp-associated invertebrate species across a system of islands isolated by oceanic gaps for over 5 million years, using mtDNA and AFLP markers. The species occur throughout New Zealand's subantarctic islands, but lack pelagic stages and any opportunity for anthropogenic transportation, and hence must rely on passive rafting for long-distance dispersal. They all have been directly observed to survive transoceanic kelp-rafting journeys in this region. Our analyses indicate that regular gene flow occurs among populations of all three species between all of the islands, especially those on either side of the subtropical front oceanographic boundary. Notwithstanding its perceived sporadic nature, long-distance kelp-rafting appears to enable significant gene flow among island populations separated by hundreds of kilometres of open ocean.},

abstract = {During summer 2009, we conducted a field experiment and a field survey at 30uS in the coastal Humboldt Current to determine how floating time affects the physiological performance of kelp rafts. For the field experiment kelp rafts were tethered in coastal waters and the field survey was specifically designed to collect free- floating Macrocystis pyrifera across a latitudinal temperature gradient that reflects natural floating time. Experimental kelps were kept under photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and PAR + ultraviolet (UV; PAR + UV) using filter foils, and tethered at the sea surface in their natural habitat. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) did not affect kelp physiology, but caused a decrease in kelp biomass. The field survey confirmed that sea-surface temperature increased with distance from upstream source populations of M. pyrifera. Rafts sampled at increasing distance from sources showed high epibiont cover and reduced blade lengths. Physiological performance declined with increasing size of algal epibionts, which are indicators of floating time. Rafts that were farthest from the southern source populations had lost their sporophylls, suggesting that dispersal potential decreases with increasing floating time. The combined effects of abiotic (UVR and temperature) and biotic factors accelerate degradation of M. pyrifera and, thus, can impede successful dispersal in the Humboldt Current at 30uS. This suggests that floating macroalgae can be important dispersal vectors in areas with moderate environmental stress (i.e., in temperate oceans)},

abstract = {Kelp rafts were surveyed during three summer traverses between Hobart and Macquarie Island (subAntarctic) to determine the potential for dispersal of kelp-associated macroinvertebrates across the latitudes of 46-53degreesS. Rafts of Durvillaea antarctica dominated the sightings (94{\%} of rafts) and extrapolations to the full Southern Ocean between these latitudes indicate a figure of over 70 million rafts afloat at any one time, 20 million of which support a holdfast, the habitat supporting the highest faunal diversity in attached kelp plants. In contrast, few, small rafts of Macrocystis pyrifera were observed. The potential for dispersal of fauna is presumed to be related to the species of kelp with which they are associated. Empirical studies of survival of animals while drifting at sea, and also on making land-fall, are required to allow fuller interpretation of the significance of these findings.},

north of its range) had a float-bearing kelp (Nereocystis

consideration of the COI-5P barcode data in support of a ``kelp

abstract = {The bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica is a common floating alga in the southern hemisphere, but despite the ecological and biogeographic importance of kelp rafts, little is known about the responses of detached kelps to the conditions at the sea surface. The morphological, physiological and reproductive performances of D. antarctica rafts in the Coastal System of Coquimbo, Chile (CSC, {\~{}}30°S), were examined during winter and summer of two successive years (2010/11 and 2011/12). Epibionts (Lepas spp.) that only attach to floating objects were used as indicator for the floating time of kelp rafts. Photosynthetic efficiency and reproductive maturity of both benthic and floating algae varied seasonally, with a stronger decrease in summer than in winter. Blade size (measured as weight proportion of kelp individuals), phlorotannin concentrations and antioxidant activities were lower in floating than in benthic algae. Environmental conditions and floating time affected the blade tissues, with stronger negative effects during summer. These results confirm that floating persistence of D. antarctica in the CSC is suppressed during the summer months, which indicates that the dispersal potential of this (and other) floating algae varies seasonally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Abstract:Floating seaweeds are important dispersal vehicles, especially for organisms with limited movement capacities and for the seaweeds themselves. The persistence of floating seaweeds is determined by the balance between their acclimation potential and the environmental pressures at the sea surface. Solar radiation is the most important inducer of physiological stress, varying in intensity throughout the day and the year. Therefore photoinhibition and subsequent recovery can change depending on the daily radiation dose and season. The bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica is one of the most common floating seaweeds in the southern oceans, including New Zealand, Chile, and most subantarctic islands. Herein, daily cycles of maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), photoinhibition and recovery levels were examined in microcosm experiments with floating D. antarctica throughout the year, focusing on the blade side exposed to solar radiation (sunny vs shadow side). Also, the effect of simulated wave action (blade turnover) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on photoinhibition and recovery of Fv/Fm was evaluated. Significant differences in maximum quantum yield were observed between blade sides, with lowest values on the sun-exposed side, especially during noontime and spring/summer months. Phlorotannins and pigments were measured during seasons with the most intense solar radiation (late spring, early summer), when Fv/Fm values were lowest. Phlorotannin, but not pigment concentrations, differed between sunny (lower concentration) and shadow blade sides (higher concentration) and throughout the daily cycle. Both blade sides had similar photoinhibition and recovery levels when blades were constantly turned over. Absence of UVR favoured the recovery capacity of Fv/Fm in both blade sides, suggesting that the photorecovery potential of floating kelps depends on the environmental conditions that kelp rafts face at the sea surface (e.g. cloudy vs sunny days, intense seawater movement and splashing vs calm sea conditions). The results confirm that photobiological stress is more severe during summer and on continuously sun-exposed blade sides, thereby damaging the blades and suppressing the floating time of D. antarctica.},

@article{thiel2005a,
abstract = {Rafting has been inferred as an important dispersal mechanism in the marine environ- ment by many authors. The success of rafting depends critically on the availability of suitable floating substrata. Herein currently available information on floating items that have been reported to carry rafting organisms is summarised. Floating items of biotic origin comprise macroalgae, seeds, wood, other vascular plants, and animal remains. Volcanic pumice (natural) and a diverse array of litter and tar lumps (anthropogenic) are the main floating items of abiotic origin. Macroal- gae, wood, and plastic macrolitter cover a wide range of sizes while pumice, microlitter, and tar lumps typically are {\textless}10 cm in diameter. The longevity of floating items at the sea surface depends on their origin and likelihood to be destroyed by secondary consumers (in increasing order): nonlignified vascular plants/animal carcasses {\textless} macroalgae {\textless} driftwood {\textless} tar lumps/skeletal remains {\textless} plastic litter {\textless} volcanic pumice. In general, abiotic substrata have a higher longevity than biotic substrata, but most abiotic items are of no or only limited food value for potential rafters. Macroalgae are most abundant at mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, driftwood is of major importance in northern and tropical waters, and floating seeds appear to be most common in tropical regions. Volcanic pumice can be found at all latitudes but has primarily been reported from the Pacific Ocean. Plastic litter and tar lumps are most abundant near the centres of human population and activities. In some regions of abundant supply or zones of hydrography-driven accumulation, floating items can be extremely abundant, exceeding 1000 items km –2 . Temporal supply of floating items is variable, being seasonal for most biotic substrata and highly sporadic for some items such as volcanic pumice. Most reported velocities of floating items are in the range of 0.5–1.0 km h –1 , but direct measurements have shown that they occasionally are transported at much faster velocities. Published trajectories of floating items also coincide with the main oceanic currents, even though strong winds may sometimes push them out of the principal current systems. Many studies hint toward floating items to link source regions with coastal sinks, in some cases across long distances and even entire ocean basins. Fossil evidence suggests that rafting has also occurred in palaeo- oceans. During recent centuries and decades the composition and abundance of floating items in the world's oceans have been strongly affected by human activities, in particular logging, river and coastline regulation, and most importantly oil exploitation and plastic production. The currently abundant supply and the characteristics of floating items suggest that rafting continues to be an important dispersal mechanism in present-day oceans.},

abstract = {Floating macroalgae are common dispersal vehicles for associated benthic invertebrates. In order to investigate the importance of kelp rafts for species dispersal in the Patagonian Fjord Region (PFR), the abundance and distribution pattern of floating kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera, Durvillaea antarctica) and of the invertebrate fauna associated with M. pyrifera were evaluated during austral spring of 2002–2005, 2008 and 2010. In the southernmost Magellan Region (MR), benthic M. pyrifera were additionally sampled to compare the community structures in both conditions. Floating kelps were abundant throughout the entire PFR, harbouring a diverse and abundant invertebrate fauna. The density of floating kelps increased towards the south. In the MR, a loss of species was observed between benthic and floating condition (e.g. decapods, echinoderms, several peracarid species), but a high diversity of organisms from all major phyla were observed on rafts. Throughout the PFR, the predominant rafting species belonged to the peracarids, molluscs and annelids, but the community composition differed between floating samples from the northern and southern zones of the PFR. Relative abundances of peracarids were higher in northern zones, whereas molluscs and annelids dominated in the southern areas. Species of the peracarid genera Peramphithoe, Gondogeneia, Bircenna and Limnoria were shared between all areas. The results suggest that kelp rafts not only contribute to local population connectivity in the PFR, but could also be an important dispersal vehicle for rafting species along the PFR in north–south direction, crossing the biogeographic boundary around Taitao Peninsula. Furthermore, the MR appears to be an important stepping stone for species dispersal via kelp rafting in the subantarctic region.},
